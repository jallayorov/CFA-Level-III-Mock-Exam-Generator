Learning Module 1  C apital Market Expectations, Part 1: Framework and Macro Considerations 4
INTRODUCTION & FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPING 
CAPITAL MARKET EXPECTATIONS
discuss the role of, and a framework for, capital market expectations 
in the portfolio management process
A noted investment authority has written that the “fundamental law of investing is the uncertainty of the future. ”
1 Investors have no choice but to forecast elements of 
the future because nearly all investment decisions look toward it. Specifically, invest -
ment decisions incorporate the decision maker’s expectations concerning factors 
and events believed to affect investment values. The decision maker integrates these views into expectations about the risk and return prospects of individual assets and groups of assets.
This reading’s focus is capital market expectations (CME) expectations concern -
ing the risk and return prospects of asset classes, however broadly or narrowly the 
investor defines those asset classes. Capital market expectations are an essential input 
to formulating a strategic asset allocation. For example, if an investor’s investment policy statement specifies and defines eight permissible asset classes, the investor will need to have formulated long-term expectations concerning each of those asset classes. The investor may also act on short-term expectations. Insights into capital 
markets gleaned during CME setting should also help in formulating the expectations 
concerning individual assets that are needed in security selection and valuation.
This is the first of two readings on capital market expectations. A central theme of 
both readings is that a disciplined approach to setting expectations will be rewarded. With that in mind, Sections 1 and 2 of this reading present a general framework for developing capital market expectations and alert the reader to the range of problems 
and pitfalls that await investors and analysts in this arena. Sections 3–11 focus on the 
use of macroeconomic analysis in setting expectations. The second of the two CME readings builds on this foundation to address setting expectations for specific asset 
classes: equities, fixed income, real estate, and currencies. Various analytical tools are 
reviewed as needed throughout both readings.
Framework and Challenges
In this section, we provide a guide to collecting, organizing, combining, and interpret -
ing investment information. After outlining the process, we turn to a discussion of 
typical problems and challenges to formulating the most informed judgments possible.
Before laying out the framework, we must be clear about what it needs to accom-
plish. The ultimate objective is to develop a set of projections with which to make informed investment decisions, specifically asset allocation decisions. As obvious as this goal may seem, it has important implications.
Asset allocation is the primary determinant of long-run portfolio performance.
2 
The projections underlying these decisions are among the most important determi-nants of whether investors achieve their long-term goals. It thus follows that it is vital to get the long-run level of returns (approximately) right. Until the late 1990s, it was standard practice for institutional investors to extrapolate historical return

Introduction & Framework for Developing Capital Market Expectations 5
data into forecasts. At the height of the technology bubble,3 this practice led many 
to project double-digit portfolio returns into the indefinite future. Such inflated 
projections allowed institutions to underfund their obligations and/or set unrealistic 
goals, many of which have had to be scaled back. Since that time, most institutions have adopted explicitly forward-looking methods of the type(s) discussed in our two CME readings, and return projections have declined sharply. Indeed, as of the begin-ning of 2018, consensus rate of return projections seemed to imply that US private foundations, which must distribute at least 5% of assets annually, could struggle to prudently generate long-run returns sufficient to cover their required distributions, 
their expenses, and inflation. To reiterate, projecting a realistic overall level of returns 
has to be a top priority.
As appealing as it is to think we could project asset returns with precision, that 
idea is unrealistic. Even the most sophisticated methods are likely to be subject to 
frustratingly large forecast errors over relevant horizons. We should, of course, seek to 
limit our forecast errors. We should not, however, put undue emphasis on the precision 
of projections for individual asset classes. Far more important objectives are to ensure 
internal consistency across asset classes (cross-sectional consistency) and over various 
time horizons (intertemporal consistency). This emphasis stems once again from the primary use of the projections—asset allocation decisions. Inconsistency across asset classes is likely to result in portfolios with poor risk–return characteristics over any horizon, whereas intertemporal inconsistency is likely to distort the connection between portfolio decisions and investment horizon.
Our discussion adopts the perspective of an analyst or team responsible for devel-
oping projections to be used by the firm’s investment professionals in advising and/or 
managing portfolios for its clients. As the setting of explicit capital market expectations 
has become both more common and more sophisticated, many asset managers have adopted this centralized approach, enabling them to leverage the requisite expertise and deliver more consistent advice to all their clients.
A Framework for Developing Capital Market Expectations
The following is a framework for a disciplined approach to setting CME.
1.
 S
pecify the set of expectations needed, including the time horizon(s) to which 
they apply. This step requires the analyst to formulate an explicit list of the 
asset classes and investment horizon(s) for which projections are needed.
2.
 R
esearch the historical record. Most forecasts have some connection to the 
past. For many markets, the historical record contains useful information on the asset’s investment characteristics, suggesting at least some possible ranges for future results. Beyond the raw historical facts, the analyst should seek to identify and understand the factors that affect asset class returns.
3.
 S
pecify the method(s) and/or model(s) to be used and their information 
requirements. The analyst or team responsible for developing CME should be explicit about the method(s) and/or model(s) that will be used and should be able to justify the selection.
4.
 D
etermine the best sources for information needs. The analyst or team must 
identify those sources that provide the most accurate and timely informa-tion tailored to their needs.
3 E xplosive growth of the internet in the late 1990s was accompanied by soaring valuations for virtually any 
internet-related investment. The NASDAQ composite index, which was very heavily weighted in technology 
stocks, nearly quintupled from 1997 to early 2000, then gave up all of those gains by mid-2002. A variety of names have been given to this episode including the tech or technology bubble.

5. I nterpret the current investment environment using the selected data and 
methods, applying experience and judgment. Care should be taken to apply 
a common set of assumptions, compatible methodologies, and consistent judgments in order to ensure mutually consistent projections across asset classes and over time horizons.
6.
 P
rovide the set of expectations needed, documenting conclusions. The pro-
jections should be accompanied by the reasoning and assumptions behind them.
7.
 M
onitor actual outcomes and compare them with expectations, providing 
feedback to improve the expectations-setting process. The most effective prac -
tice is likely to synchronize this step with the expectations-setting process, monitoring and reviewing outcomes on the same cycle as the projections are updated, although several cycles may be required to validate conclusions.
The first step in the CME framework requires the analyst to define the universe 
of asset classes for which she will develop expectations. The universe should include all of the asset classes that will typically be accorded a distinct allocation in client portfolios. To put it another way, the universe needs to reflect the key dimensions of decision making in the firm’s investment process. On the other hand, the universe 
should be as small as possible because even pared down to minimum needs, the 
expectations-setting process can be quite challenging.
Steps 2 and 3 in the process involve understanding the historical performance 
of the asset classes and researching their return drivers. The information that needs to be collected mirrors considerations that defined the universe of assets in step 1. The more granular the classification of assets, the more granular the breakdown of 
information will need to be to support the investment process. Except in the simplest 
of cases, the analyst will need to slice the data in multiple dimensions. Among these are the following:
 ■Geography: global, regional, domestic versus non-domestic, economic blocs (e.g., the European Union), individual countries;
 ■Major asset classes: equity, fixed-income, real assets;
 ■Sub-asset classes:
 ●Equities: styles, sizes, sectors, industries;
 ●Fixed income: maturities, credit quality, securitization, fixed versus float -
ing, nominal or inflation-protected;
 ●Real assets: real estate, commodities, timber.
How each analyst approaches this task depends on the hierarchy of decisions in 
their investment process. One firm may prioritize segmenting the global equity market 
by Global Industry Classification Standard (GIC) sector, with geographic distinctions 
accorded secondary consideration, while another firm prioritizes decisions with respect 
to geography considering sector breakdowns as secondary.4
In Step 3, the analyst needs to be sensitive to the fact that both the effectiveness of 
forecasting approaches and relationships among variables are related to the investor’s 
time horizon. As an example, a discounted cash flow approach to setting equity market 
expectations is usually considered to be most appropriate to long-range forecasting. 
If forecasts are also to be made for shorter, finite horizons, intertemporal consistency 
dictates that the method used for those projections must be calibrated so that its projections converge to the long-range forecast as the horizon extends.
4 Ther e is extensive literature on the relative importance of country versus industry factors in global 
equity markets. Marcelo, Quiros, and Martins (2013) summarized the evidence as “vast and contradictory. ”

Executing the fourth step—determining the best information sources—requires 
researching the quality of alternative data sources and striving to fully understand the 
data. Using flawed or misunderstood data is a recipe for faulty analysis. Furthermore, 
analysts should be alert to new, superior data sources. Large, commercially available 
databases and reputable financial publications are likely the best avenue for obtaining 
widely disseminated information covering the broad spectrum of asset classes and 
geographies. Trade publications, academic studies, government and central bank 
reports, corporate filings, and broker/dealer and third-party research often provide 
more specialized information. Appropriate data frequencies must be selected. Daily series are of more use for setting shorter-term expectations. Monthly, quarterly, or annual data series are useful for setting longer-term CME.
The first four steps lay the foundation for the heart of the process: the fifth and 
sixth steps. Monitoring and interpreting the economic and market environment and 
assessing the implications for relevant investments are activities the analyst should be 
doing every day. In essence, step five could be labelled “implement your investment/
research process” and step six could be labelled “at designated times, synthesize, doc -
ument, and defend your views. ” Perhaps what most distinguishes these steps from the 
day-to-day investment process is that the analyst must make simultaneous projections 
for all asset classes and all designated, concrete horizons.
Finally, in step 7 we use experience to improve the expectations-setting process. 
We measure our previously formed expectations against actual results to assess the level of accuracy the process is delivering. Generally, good forecasts are:
 ■unbiased, objective, and well researched;
 ■efficient, in the sense of minimizing the size of forecast errors; and
 ■internally consistent, both cross-sectionally and intertemporally.
Although it is important to monitor outcomes for ways in which our forecasting 
process can be improved, our ability to assess the accuracy of our forecasts may be 
severely limited. A standard rule of thumb in statistics is that we need at least 30 obser -
vations to meaningfully test a hypothesis. Quantitative evaluation of forecast errors in real time may be of limited value in refining a process that is already reasonably well constructed (i.e., not subject to obvious gross errors). Hence, the most valuable part of the feedback loop will often be qualitative and judgmental.

Capital Market Expectations Setting: Information

1. Consider two in vestment strategists charged with developing capital market 
expectations for their firms, John Pearson and Michael Wu. Pearson works 
for a bank trust department that runs US balanced separately managed accounts (SMAs) for high-net-worth individuals. These accounts’ mandates restrict investments to US equities, US investment-grade fixed-income instruments, and prime US money market instruments. The investment objective is long-term capital growth and income. In contrast, Wu works for

a large Hong Kong SAR–based, internationally focused asset manager that 
uses the following types of assets within its investment process:
 
Equities Fixed Income Alternative Investments
Asian equities  
Eurozone  
US large-cap  
US small-cap  
Canadian large-capEurozone sovereign  
US governmentEastern European  
venture capital  
New Zealand timber  
US commercial real  
estate
 
Wu’s firm runs SMAs with generally long-term time horizons and global tactical asset allocation (GTAA) programs. Compare and contrast the infor-mation and knowledge requirements of Pearson and Wu. 
Guideline Answer:Pearson’s in-depth information requirements relate to US equity and 
fixed-income markets. By contrast, Wu’s information requirements relate not only to US and non-US equity and fixed-income markets but also to three alternative investment types with non-public markets, located on three different continents. Wu has a more urgent need to be current on po-litical, social, economic, and trading-oriented operational details worldwide than Pearson. Given their respective investment time horizons, Pearson’s focus is on the long term whereas Wu needs to focus not only on the long term but also on near-term disequilibria among markets (for GTAA de-cisions). One challenge that Pearson has in US fixed-income markets that Wu does not face is the need to cover corporate and municipal as well as government debt securities. Nevertheless, Wu’s overall information and knowledge requirements are clearly more demanding than Pearson’s.
CHALLENGES IN FORECASTING
discuss challenges in developing capital market forecasts
A range of problems can frustrate analysts’ expectations-setting efforts. Expectations 
reflecting faulty analysis or assumptions may cause a portfolio manager to construct 
a portfolio that is inappropriate for the client. At the least, the portfolio manager may 
incur the costs of changing portfolio composition without any offsetting benefits. The following sections provide guidance on points that warrant special caution. The 
discussion focuses on problems in the use of data and on analyst mistakes and biases.
Limitations of Economic Data
The analyst needs to understand the definition, construction, timeliness, and accu-racy of any data used, including any biases. The time lag with which economic data are collected, processed, and disseminated can impede their use because data that are not timely may be of little value in assessing current conditions. Some economic data may be reported with a lag as short as one week, whereas other important data may be reported with a lag of more than a quarter. The International Monetary Fund 2

Challenges in Forecasting 9
sometimes reports data for developing economies with a lag of two years or more. 
Older data increase the uncertainty concerning the current state of the economy with 
respect to that variable.
Furthermore, one or more official revisions to initial data values are common. 
Sometimes these revisions are substantial, which may give rise to significantly different 
inferences. Often only the most recent data point is revised. Other series are subject 
to periodic “benchmark revisions” that simultaneously revise all or a portion of the historical data series. In either case—routine updating of the most recent release or benchmark revision—the analyst must be aware that using revised data as if it were known at the time to which it applies often suggests strong historical relationships that are unreliable for forecasting.
Definitions and calculation methods change too. For example, the US Bureau 
of Labor Statistics (BLS) made significant changes to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) in 1983 (treatment of owner-occupied housing) and again in 1991 (regression-based product quality adjustments). Analysts should also be aware that suppliers of economic and financial indexes periodically re-base these indexes, meaning that the specific period used as the base of the index is changed. 
Analysts should take care to avoid inadvertently mixing data relating to different base 
periods. Exhibit 1 illustrates the impact of re-basing a time series: Statistics Denmark 
announced that beginning January 2016, the Danish Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 
revised and the new base year is 2015. The CPI series based on the old base was no 
longer published, and the new series was computed back to 1980 retrospectively, such 
that the CPI took a value of 100.00 on 31 August 2015.

Data Measurement Errors and Biases
Analysts need to be aware of possible biases and/or errors in data series, including the following:
 ■Transcription errors. These are errors in gathering and recording data.
© CFA Institute. For candidate use only. Not for distribution.
Learning Module 1  C apital Market Expectations, Part 1: Framework and Macro Considerations 10
 ■Survivorship bias. This bias arises when a data series reflects only entities 
that survived to the end of the period. Without correction, statistics from such data can be misleading. Data on alternative assets such as hedge funds are notorious for survivorship bias.
 ■Appraisal (smoothed) data. For certain assets without liquid public markets, notably but not only real estate, appraisal data are used in lieu of transaction data. Appraised values tend to be less volatile than market-determined val-ues. As a result, measured volatilities are biased downward and correlations with other assets tend to be understated.
The Limitations of Historical Estimates
Although history is often a helpful guide, the past should not be extrapolated uncrit -
ically. There are two primary issues with respect to using historical data. First, the data may not be representative of the future period for which an analyst needs to 
forecast. Second, even if the data are representative of the future, statistics calculated 
from that data may be poor estimates of the desired metrics. Both of these issues can be addressed to some extent by imposing structure (that is, a model) on how data is presumed to have been generated in the past and how it is expected to be generated in the future.
Changes in technological, political, legal, and regulatory environments; disruptions 
such as wars and other calamities; and changes in policy stances can all alter risk–return relationships. Such shifts are known as changes in regime (the governing set 
of relationships) and give rise to the statistical problem of nonstationarity (meaning, 
informally, that different parts of a data series reflect different underlying statistical properties). Statistical tools are available to help identify and model such changes or turning points.
A practical approach for an analyst to decide whether to use the whole of a long 
data series or only part of it involves answering two questions.
1.
 Is t
here any reason to believe that the entirety of the sample period is no 
longer relevant? In other words, has there been a fundamental regime change (such as political, economic, market, or asset class structure) during the sample period?
2.
 D
o the data support the hypothesis that such a change has occurred?
If the answer to both questions is yes, the analyst should use only that part of the 
time series that appears relevant to the present. Alternatively, he may apply statistical 
techniques that account for regime changes in the past data as well as the possibility of subsequent regime changes. Example 2 illustrates examples of changes in regime.
EXAMPLE 2
Regimes and the Relevance of Historical Bond Returns
In the 1970s, oil price shocks combined with accommodative monetary policy by 
the US Federal Reserve fueled sharply rising inflation. In 1980, the Fed abruptly shifted to an aggressively tight stance. After the initial shock of sharply higher 
interest rates, US bond yields trended downward for roughly 35 years as the Fed 
kept downward pressure on inflation. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Fed 
eased monetary policy in the aftermath of the technology bubble. Then, switch -
ing to an extraordinarily expansionary policy in the midst of the 2008–2009 global financial crisis, the Fed reduced its policy rate to 0% in December 2008. 
Subsequently, it aggressively bought Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed

securities. The Fed finally raised its policy rate target in December 2015 and 
continued hiking it up until it reached 2.5% at the end of 2018. In October 2017, 
it stopped rolling over maturing bonds, allowing its balance sheet to shrink, albeit 
very slowly. After the outbreak of COVID-19, the Fed once again cut its policy 
rate target, to 0%–0.25% in March 2020. It can be argued that bond returns from 
the 1970s through 2021 reflect at least three distinct regimes: the inflationary 
1970s, with accommodative Fed policy; the 1980–2008 period of disinflationary 
policy and secularly falling yields; and the unprecedented 2009–21 period of 
zero interest rates and explosive liquidity provision. The years after the 2008-09 
global financial crisis were dominated by multiple waves of central bank asset 
buying, not only in the United States but also globally. The most recent wave of 
asset purchases (quantitative easing, or QE) came after the outbreak of COVID-
19. Exhibit 2 illustrates how QE by the Fed, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan drove long-term government yields lower—even to negative territory in some cases.

As of mid-2021, nominal interest rates were still negative in some developed 
markets, and major central banks including the Fed were aiming to “normalize” 
policy over the next few years. There is ample reason to believe that future bond 
returns will reflect a regime like none before.
In general, the analyst should use the longest data history for which there is rea-
sonable assurance of stationarity. This guideline follows from the fact that sample 
statistics from a longer history are more precise than those with fewer observations.

Challenges in Forecasting 13
Although it is tempting to assume that using higher-frequency data (e.g., monthly rather 
than annual observations) will also provide more-precise estimates, this assumption 
is not necessarily true. Although higher-frequency data improve the precision of 
sample variances, covariances, and correlations, they do not improve the precision 
of the sample mean.
When many variables are considered, a large number of observations may be a 
statistical necessity. For example, to calculate a sample covariance matrix, the num-ber of observations must exceed the number of variables (assets). Otherwise, some asset combinations (i.e., portfolios) will spuriously appear to have zero volatility. This 
problem arises frequently in investment analysis, and a remedy is available. Covariance 
matrices are routinely estimated even for huge numbers of assets by assuming that 
returns are driven by a smaller set of common factors plus uncorrelated asset-specific 
components.
As the frequency of observations increases, the likelihood increases that data may 
be asynchronous (i.e., not simultaneous or concurrent in time) across variables. This means that data points for different variables may not reflect exactly the same period 
even though they are labeled as if they do. For example, daily data from different coun -
tries are typically asynchronous because of time zone differences. Asynchronicity can 
be a significant problem for daily, and perhaps even weekly data, because it distorts measured correlations and induces lead–lag relationships that might not exist if the 
data were measured synchronously. Lower-frequency data (e.g., monthly or quarterly) 
are less susceptible to asynchrony, although it can still arise. For example, two series 
that are released and labeled as monthly could reflect data collected at different times 
of the month.
As a final note on historical data, some care should be taken with respect to whether 
data are normally distributed. Historical asset returns, in particular, routinely exhibit skewness and “fat tails, ” which cause them to fail formal tests of normality. The cost in terms of analytical complexity of accounting for non-normality, however, can be quite high. As a practical matter, the added complexity is often not worth the cost.
5
Ex Post Risk Can Be a Biased Measure of Ex Ante Risk
In interpreting historical prices and returns over a given sample period, the analyst 
needs to evaluate whether asset prices reflected the possibility of a very negative event 
that did not materialize during the period. This phenomenon is often referred to as 
the “peso problem. ” Looking backward, we are likely to underestimate ex ante  risk and 
overestimate ex ante anticipated returns. The key point is that high ex post returns 
that reflect fears of adverse events that did not materialize provide a poor estimate of ex ante expected returns.
THE ARGENTINE PESO DEVALUATIONS 
Starting in 1992, the Argentine peso (ARS) was pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 
ratio, and the ARS/USD exchange rate remained fixed at 1.0 until the Argentine 
great depression of 1998–2002, which was characterized by bank runs, riots, and 
sovereign debt default. In January 2002, the government decided to abandon the 
fixed exchange rate policy and devalued the peso to a rate of 1.4 ARS/USD. The currency was allowed to fluctuate freely, and the peso further depreciated to 3.8 ARS/USD by June 2001. Over the following years, additional default waves took place, and Argentina suffered from elevated inflation, fluctuating around

20%–40%, with fiscal imbalances over the 2010s. The 2018 Argentine monetary 
crisis led to a further severe devaluation of the peso, trading at a rate of 18.6 ARS/USD at the end of 2017 but closing the year at 37.7.
The opposite situation is also a problem, especially for risk measures that consider 
only the subset of worst-case outcomes (e.g., value at risk, or VaR). If our data series 
includes even one observation of a rare event, we may substantially overstate the like -
lihood of such events happening in the future. Within a finite sample, the observed frequency of this bad outcome will far exceed its true probability. As a simple exam-ple, there were 22 trading days in March 2020, the month of the COVID-19-related market panic. On 16 March, the price of Facebook (now named as Meta Platforms) stock closed down –14.3%. The second worst day in the same month was 12 March, 
with the stock price down –9.3%. Based on this sample, the (interpolated) daily 5% VaR 
on Facebook stock was 13.4%. That is, an investor in Facebook shares would expect to lose at least 13.4% once every 20 days. Note that the stock did not experience any such loss over the subsequent 19 months.
Biases in Analysts’ Methods
Analysts naturally search for relationships that will help in developing better capital market expectations. Among the preventable biases that the analyst may introduce are the following:
 ■Data-mining bias arises from repeatedly searching a dataset until a statisti-cally significant pattern emerges. It is almost inevitable that some relation-ship will appear. Such patterns cannot be expected to have predictive value. Lack of an explicit economic rationale for a variable’s usefulness is a warning sign of a data-mining problem: no story, no future.
6 Of course, the analyst 
must be wary of inventing the story after discovering the relationship and bear in mind that correlation does not imply causation.
 ■Time-period bias relates to results that are period specific. Research find-ings often turn out to be sensitive to the selection of specific starting and/or ending dates.
SMALL-CAP OUTPERFORMANCE AND TIME-PERIOD BIAS
Evidence suggesting that small-cap stocks outperform large-cap stocks over 
time (the so-called small firm effect) is very sensitive to the choice of sample period. From 1926 through 1974, US small-cap stocks outperformed large caps by 0.43% per year, but if we skip the Great Depression and start in 1932, the 
differential becomes 3.49% per year. Similarly, small caps outperformed by 4.5% 
per year from 2000 through 2010 but underperformed by –2.8% per year from 2010 through 2020.
7
How might analysts avoid using an irrelevant variable in a forecasting model? The 
analyst should scrutinize the variable selection process for data-mining bias and be able to provide an economic rationale for the variable’s usefulness in a forecasting model. A further practical check is to examine the forecasting relationship out of sample (i.e., on data that was not used to estimate the relationship).

The Failure to Account for Conditioning Information
The discussion of regimes introduced the notion that assets’ risk and return char -
acteristics vary with the economic and market environment. That fact explains why 
economic analysis is important in expectation setting. The analyst should not ignore 
relevant information or analysis in formulating expectations. Unconditional forecasts, 
which dilute this information by averaging over environments, can lead to misper -
ception of prospective risk and return. Example 3 illustrates how an analyst may use conditioning information.
EXAMPLE 3
Incorporating Conditioning Information
Noah Sota uses the CAPM to set capital market expectations. He estimates that 
one asset class has a beta of 0.8 in economic expansions and 1.2 in recessions. 
The expected return on the market is 12% in an expansion and 4% in a recession. 
The risk-free rate is assumed to be constant at 2%. Expansion and recession are equally likely. Sota aims to calculate the unconditional expected return for the asset class.
The conditional expected returns on the asset are 10% = 2% + 0.8 × (12% − 
2%) in an expansion and 4.4% = 2% + 1.2 × (4% − 2%) in a recession. Weighting 
by the probabilities of expansion and recession, the unconditional expected 
return is 7.2% = [(0.5 × 10%) + (0.5 × 4.4%)].
EXAMPLE 4
Ignoring Conditioning Information
1. F ollowing on from the scenario in Example 3, one of Noah Sota’s colleagues 
suggests an alternative approach to calculate the unconditional expected re-turn for the asset class. His method is to calculate the unconditional beta to be used in the CAPM formula, 1.0 = (0.5 × 0.8) + (0.5 × 1.2). He then works out the unconditional expected return on the market portfolio, 8% = (0.5 × 12%) + (0.5 × 4%). Finally, using the unconditional beta and the uncondi-tional market return, he calculates the unconditional expected return on the asset class as 8.0% = 2.0% + 1.0 × (8% − 2%).
Explain why the alternative approach is right or wrong. 
Guideline Answer:The approach suggested by Sota’s colleague is wrong. It ignores the fact 
that the market excess return and the asset’s beta vary with the business cycle. The expected return of 8% calculated this way would overestimate the (unconditional) expected return on this asset class. Such a return forecast would ignore the fact that the beta differs for expansion (0.8) and recession (1.2).

Misinterpretation of Correlations
When a variable A  is found to be significantly correlated with another variable B , 
there are at least four possible explanations: (1) A predicts B, (2) B predicts A, (3) 
a third variable C predicts both A and B, or (4) the relationship is spurious. The 
observed correlation alone does not allow us to distinguish among these situations. 
Consequently, correlation relationships should not be used in a predictive model 
without investigating the underlying linkages.
Although apparently significant correlations can be spurious, it is also true that 
lack of a strong correlation can be misleading. A negligible measured correlation may 
reflect a strong but nonlinear relationship. Analysts should explore this possibility if 
they have a solid reason for believing a relationship exists.
Psychological Biases
The behavioral finance literature documents a long and growing list of psychological 
biases that can affect investment decisions. Only a few of the more prominent ones that could undermine the analyst’s ability to make accurate and unbiased forecasts are outlined here. Furthermore, note that the literature contains various names and definitions of behavioral biases, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
 ■Anchoring bias is the tendency to give disproportionate weight to the first information received or first number envisioned, which is then adjusted. Such adjustment is often insufficient, and approximations are consequently biased. Analysts can try to avoid anchoring bias by consciously attempting to avoid premature conclusions.
 ■Status quo bias reflects the tendency for forecasts to perpetuate recent observations—that is, to avoid making changes and preserve the status quo, and/or to accept a default option. This bias may reflect greater pain from errors of commission (making a change) than from errors of omission (doing nothing). Status quo bias can be mitigated by disciplined effort to avoid “anchoring” on the status quo.
 ■Confirmation bias is the tendency to seek and overweight evidence or infor -
mation that confirms one’s existing or preferred beliefs and to discount evi-dence that contradicts those beliefs. This bias can be mitigated by examining all evidence with equal rigor and/or debating with a knowledgeable person capable of arguing against one’s own views.
 ■Overconfidence bias is unwarranted confidence in one’s own intuitive reasoning, judgment, knowledge, and/or ability. This bias may lead an analyst to overestimate the accuracy of her forecasts and/or fail to consider a sufficiently broad range of possible outcomes or scenarios. Analysts may not only fail to fully account for uncertainty about which they are aware (sometimes described as “known unknowns”) but they also are very likely to ignore the possibility of uncertainties about which they are not even aware (sometimes described as “unknown unknowns”).
 ■Prudence bias reflects the tendency to temper forecasts so that they do not appear extreme or the tendency to be overly cautious in forecasting. In decision-making contexts, one may be too cautious when making decisions that could damage one’s career or reputation. This bias can be mitigated by conscious effort to identify plausible scenarios that would give rise to more extreme outcomes and to give greater weight to such scenarios in the forecast.

Challenges in Forecasting 17
 ■Availability bias is the tendency to be overly influenced by events that have 
left a strong impression and/or for which it is easy to recall an example. Recent events may likewise be overemphasized. The effect of this bias can be mitigated by attempting to base conclusions on objective evidence and analytical procedures.
EXAMPLE 5
Biases in Forecasting and Decision Making
1. C ynthia Casey is a London-based investment adviser with a clientele of 
ultra-high-net-worth individuals in the UK, the US, and the EU. Within the equity portion of her portfolios, she rarely deviates significantly from the country weightings of the MSCI World Index, even though more often than not she tilts the allocation in the right direction. Hence, she can claim a good tactical track record despite having added little value in terms of return through tactical allocation. Because most investors have an implicit “home bias, ” her European clients tend to view their portfolios as significant-ly overweight the US (nearly 50% of the World index) and are happy because the US market outperformed the MSCI World ex-US Index by about 8% per year over the 10 years ending 31 December 2020. Conversely, her US clients are unhappy because Casey persistently projected US outperformance but maintained what they instinctively perceive as a significant underweight in the United States. Citing year-to-date performance as of 31 December 2020—US performance was up 21%, while World ex-US performance was up 8%, largely lagging behind the United States, with 8 of 15 European mar-kets actually down in local currencies—Casey’s US clients are pressuring her to aggressively increase allocations to US equities. Although experience has taught her to be wary of chasing a strong market, Casey vividly remembers losing clients in the late 1990s because she doubted that the explosive rally in technology stocks would be sustained. With that in mind, she has looked for and found a rationale for a bullish view on US stocks—very robust year-to-date earnings growth.
What psychological biases are Casey and her clients exhibiting? 
Guideline Answer:Casey’s clients are implicitly anchoring their expectations on the perfor-
mance of their respective domestic markets. In pressing Casey to increase the allocation to US stocks based on recent outperformance, her US clients are clearly projecting continuation of the trend, a status quo bias. Casey herself is exhibiting several biases. Prudence bias is apparent in the fact that she has a good record of projecting the correct direction of relative perfor-mance among markets but has not translated that into reallocations large enough to add meaningful value. We cannot assess whether that bias affects the magnitude of her forecasts, the extent to which she responds to the opportunities, or both. Losing clients when she doubted the sustainability of the late 1990s technology rally made a very strong impression on Casey, so much so that she has apparently convinced herself to look for a reason to believe the recent relative performance trends will persist. This is indicative of availability bias. Searching for evidence to support a favored view (contin-ued strength of the US market) is a clear sign of confirmation bias, whereas

finding support for that view in the recent strength of earnings growth 
reflects status quo bias.
Model Uncertainty
The analyst usually encounters at least three kinds of uncertainty in conducting an 
analysis. Model uncertainty pertains to whether a selected model is structurally and/
or conceptually correct. Parameter uncertainty arises because a quantitative model’s 
parameters are invariably estimated with error. Input uncertainty concerns whether the inputs are correct. Any or all of these may give rise to erroneous forecasts and/or cause the unwary analyst to overestimate the accuracy and reliability of his forecasts.
The effects of parameter uncertainty can be mitigated through due attention to 
estimation errors. Input uncertainty arises primarily from the need to proxy for an unobservable variable such as “the market portfolio” in the CAPM. Whether or not 
this is a serious issue depends on the context. It is a problem if the analyst wants to test 
the validity of the underlying theory or identify “anomalies” relative to the model. It is 
less of an issue if the analyst is merely focused on useful empirical relationships rather 
than proof of concept/theory. Model uncertainty is potentially the most serious issue because the wrong model may lead an analyst to fundamentally flawed conclusions.
Our discussion of the limitations of historical data touched on a model that led 
many investors far astray in the late 1990s. Up to that point, the implicit model used 
by many, if not most, institutional investors for setting long-term equity expectations 
was, “The ex ante expected return is, was, and always will be a constant number μ, and 
the best estimate of that number is the mean over the longest sample available. ” As the market soared in the late 1990s, the historical estimate of μ rose steadily, leading investors to shift more heavily into equities, which fueled further price appreciation and more reallocation toward equities, and so on, until the technology bubble burst. 
Ironically, belief in the sanctity of historical estimates coincided with the diametrically 
opposed notion that the “new economy” made historical economic and market rela-tionships obsolete. There seemed to be no limits to growth or to valuations, at least in some segments of the market. But, of course, there were. This description of the technology bubble illustrates the breakdown of a particular forecasting model. It is not a literal description of anyone’s thought process. For various reasons, however—
competitive pressures, status quo/availability/prudence biases—many investors acted 
as if they were following the model.
Another flawed model unraveled during the global financial crisis of 2007–2009. 
One component of that model was the notion that housing price declines are geo-
graphically isolated events: There was no risk of a nationwide housing slump. A second 
component involved “originate to sell” loan pipelines: businesses that made loans with 
the intention of immediately selling them to investors and therefore had very little incentive to vet loan quality. A third component was the notion that the macro risk 
of an ever-growing supply of increasingly poor-quality mortgages could be diversified 
away by progressive layers of securitization. End investors were implicitly sold the 
notion that the securities were low risk because numerous computer simulations 
showed that the “micro” risk of individual loans was well diversified. The macro risk of a housing crisis, however, was not reflected in prices and yields—until, of course, the model proved to be flawed. The scenario highlighted here provides another illus -
tration of a particular model breaking down. In this case, it was a flawed model of risk 
and diversification, and its breakdown was one of many aspects of the financial crisis.

Economic and Market Analysis: The Role of Economic Analysis and Analysis of Economic Growth: Exogenous Shocks to Growth 19
ECONOMIC AND MARKET ANALYSIS: THE ROLE OF 
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND ANALYSIS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH: EXOGENOUS SHOCKS TO GROWTH
explain how exogenous shocks may affect economic growth trends
The previous section outlined various pitfalls in forecasting. Each of these is important. 
Yet they pale in comparison to a fundamental mistake: losing sight of the fact that 
investment outcomes are inherently linked to the economy. The technology bubble and the global financial crisis offer two extreme illustrations of the consequences of falling into this trap. Less dramatic, but still consequential, instances of this mistake 
regularly contribute to the differential investment performance that separates “winners” 
and “losers. ” The remainder of this reading is dedicated to effective incorporation of economic and market analysis into capital market expectations.
The Role of Economic Analysis
History has shown that there is a direct yet variable relationship among actual realized 
asset returns, expectations for future asset returns, and economic activity. Analysts 
need to be familiar with the historical relationships that empirical research has uncov -
ered concerning the direction, strength, and lead–lag relationships between economic 
variables and capital market returns.
The analyst who understands which economic variables may be most relevant to 
the current economic environment has a competitive advantage, as does the analyst who can discern or forecast changes in acceleration and deceleration of a trend.
Economic output has both cyclical and trend growth components. Trend growth is 
of obvious relevance for setting long-term return expectations for asset classes such as 
equities. Cyclical variation affects variables such as corporate profits and interest rates, 
which are directly related to asset class returns and risk. In the following sections, we address trend growth, business cycles, the role of monetary and fiscal policies, and international interactions.
Analysis of Economic Growth
The economic growth trend is the long-term average growth path of GDP around which the economy experiences semi-regular business cycles. The analyst needs to 
understand and analyze both the trend and the cycles. Though each could exist without 
the other, they are related.
It might seem that trends are inherently easier to forecast than cycles. After all, 
trends are about long-term averages, whereas cycles are about shorter-term movements 
and turning points. The assumption that trends are easier to forecast would be true if trend growth rates were constant. But trend growth rates do change, which is what 
makes forecasting them relevant for investment analysis. Some changes are fairly easy 
to forecast because they are driven by slowly evolving and easily observable factors 
such as demographics. Trend changes that arise from significant “exogeneous shocks” 
to underlying economic and/or market relationships are not only impossible to foresee 
but also difficult to identify, assess, and quantify until the change is well-established and retrospectively revealed in the data. Virtually by definition, the effect of truly 3

exogenous shocks on the level and/or growth rate of the economy will not have been 
built into asset prices in advance—although the risk of such events will likely have been reflected in prices to some degree.
Exogenous Shocks to Growth
Shocks arise from various sources. Some are purely domestic. Others are transmitted 
from other parts of the globe. Some are negative for potential growth, while others 
enhance it. Significant shocks typically arise from the following:
 ■Policy changes. Elements of pro-growth government policies include sound fiscal policy, minimal intrusion on the private sector, encouraging competi-tion within the private sector, support for infrastructure and human capital development, and sound tax policies. Any significant, unexpected change in these policies that is likely to persist will change the expected trend rate of growth. The overhaul of US business taxes at the end of 2017, although not entirely unexpected, was intended to be a pro-growth change in policy. On the other hand, standard economic arguments indicate that erecting trade barriers will diminish trend growth.
 ■New products and technologies. Creation and assimilation of new products, markets, and technologies enhances potential growth. Consider the printing press, steam engine, telegraph and telephone, railroad, automobile, airplane, transistor, random-access memory (RAM), integrated circuits, internet, wireless communication (radio, TV, smartphone), rockets, and satellites, to name just a few.
 ■Geopolitics. Geopolitical conflict has the potential to reduce growth by diverting resources to less economically productive uses (e.g., accumulating and maintaining weapons, discouraging beneficial trade). The fall of the Berlin wall, which triggered German reunification and a “peace dividend” for governments as they cut defense spending, was a growth-enhancing geo-political shock. Interestingly, geopolitical tensions (e.g., the space race) can also spur innovation that results in growth-enhancing technologies.
 ■Natural disasters. Natural disasters destroy productive capacity. In the short run, a disaster is likely to reduce growth, but it may actually enhance long-run growth if old capacity is replaced with more efficient facilities.
 ■Natural resources/critical inputs. Discovery of new natural resources or of new ways to recover them (e.g., fracking) can be expected to enhance potential growth, directly via production of those resources and indirectly by reducing the cost of production for other products. Conversely, sustained reduction in the supply of important resources diminishes growth (e.g., the OPEC oil shock in 1973).
 ■Financial crises. The financial system allows the economy to channel resources to their most efficient use. Financial crises arise when market participants lose confidence in others’ ability (or willingness) to meet their obligations and cease to provide funding—first to specific counterparties and then more broadly as potential losses cascade through the system. As discussed in Example 6, a financial crisis may affect both the level of output and the trend growth rate.

EXAMPLE 6
Trend Growth after a Financial Crisis
An extensive study of growth and debt dynamics in the wake of the 2007–2009 
global financial crisis identified three types of crises:
 ■Type 1: A persistent (permanent, one-time) decline in the level of out -
put, but the subsequent trend rate of growth is unchanged.
 ■Type 2: No persistent decline in the level of output, but the subsequent trend rate of growth is reduced.
 ■Type 3: Both a persistent decline in the level of output and a reduction in the subsequent trend rate of growth.
The eurozone experienced a sharp, apparently permanent drop in output 
after the global financial crisis, and subsequent growth was markedly lower than 
before the crisis, suggesting a Type 3 crisis.
The eurozone’s stagnant growth may be traced to structural problems in 
conjunction with policy missteps. Structural issues included rigid labor markets, 
a relatively rapid aging of the population, legal and regulatory barriers, cultural 
differences among countries, use of a common currency in dissimilar economies, 
and lack of a unified fiscal policy. In terms of policy response, the European Central Bank was slow to cut rates, was slow to expand its balance sheet, and failed to sustain that expansion. Insolvent banks were allowed to remain oper -
ational, thwarting deleveraging of the financial system. In part as the result of a lack of fiscal integration that would have facilitated cross-country transfers, several countries were forced to adopt drastic budget cuts that magnified the impact on their particular economies, the differential impact across countries, and the consequences of structural impediments.
Note: See Buttiglione, Lane, Reichlin, and Reinhart (2014).
It should be clear that any of the shocks listed would likely constitute a “regime 
change” as discussed earlier.
EXAMPLE 7
Impact of Exogenous Shocks on Trend Growth
1. P hilippe Leblanc, an analyst focusing on economic forecasting, recently 
read about a discovery by scientists at a major university that may allow the efficiency of solar panels to double every two to three years, a result similar to Moore’s Law with respect to computer chips. In further reading, he found new research at Tsinghua University that may rapidly increase the distance over which electricity can be transmitted.
What implications should Leblanc draw with regard to growth trends if 
either, or both, of these developments come to fruition? What government policy changes might offset the impact? 
Guideline Answer:Either of these developments would be expected to increase trend growth. 
They would be especially powerful together. Rapid increases in solar panel efficiency would drive down the cost of energy over time, especially in areas with long days and intense sunlight. The closer to the equator, the larger the

potential effect. The developments would also make it increasingly possible 
to bring large-scale power production to remote areas, thereby expanding the range and scale of economically viable businesses in those areas. Ex-tending the range of electrical transmission would allow moving lower-cost energy (regardless of how it is generated) to where it is most efficiently used. A variety of government actions could undermine the pro-growth nature of these developments; for example, tariffs on solar panels, restrictions on elec-trical transmission lines, subsidies to support less efficient energy sources, failure to protect intellectual property rights, or prohibition on transfer of technology.
APPLYING GROWTH ANALYSIS TO CAPITAL MARKET 
EXPECTATIONS
discuss the application of economic growth trend analysis to the 
formulation of capital market expectations 
The expected trend rate of economic growth is a key consideration in a variety of contexts. First, it is an important input to discounted cash flow models of expected return. The trend growth rate imposes discipline on forecasts of fundamental met -
rics such as earnings because these must be kept consistent with aggregate long-run growth at the trend rate. Second, a country with a higher trend rate of growth may offer equity investors a particularly good return if that growth has not already been priced into the market. Third, a higher trend rate of growth in the economy allows 
actual growth to be faster before accelerating inflation becomes a significant concern. 
This fact is especially important in projecting the likely path of monetary policy and 
bond yields. Fourth, theory implies, and empirical evidence confirms, that the average 
level of real government bond yields is linked to the trend growth rate. Faster trend growth implies higher average real yields.
Most countries have had periods of faster and slower trend growth during their 
development. Emerging countries often experience rapid growth as they catch up with the leading industrial countries, but the more developed they become, the more likely it is that their growth will slow.
A Decomposition of GDP Growth and Its Use in Forecasting
The simplest way to analyze an economy’s aggregate trend growth is to split it into the following components:
 ■growth from labor inputs, consisting of
 ●growth in potential labor force size and
 ●growth in actual labor force participation, plus
 ■growth from labor productivity, consisting of
 ●growth from increasing capital inputs and
 ●growth in total factor productivity.4
© CFA Institute. For candidate use only. Not for distribution.
Applying Growth Analysis to Capital Market Expectations 23
Labor input encompasses both the number of workers and the average number of 
hours they work. Growth in the potential labor force size is driven by demographics 
such as the population’s age distribution, net migration, and workplace norms such as the length of the work week. All of these factors tend to change slowly, making 
growth in the potential labor force relatively predictable. Trends in net migration and 
workplace norms, however, may change abruptly in response to sudden structural changes, such as changes in government policies.
Labor force participation primarily reflects labor versus leisure decisions by 
workers. All else the same, we should expect labor force participation to decline (or at least grow more slowly) as a country becomes more affluent. On the other hand, rising real wages tend to attract workers back into the labor force. Social norms and government policies also play a large role.
Growth in labor productivity comes from investment in additional capital per 
worker (“capital deepening”) and from increases in total factor productivity (TFP), 
which is often taken to be synonymous with technological improvement.8 Government 
policy (e.g., regulations) can also influence TFP . In historical analyses, TFP is often measured as a “residual”—that is, output growth that is not accounted for by the other factors.
The trend rate of growth in mature, developed markets is generally fairly stable. 
As a result, extrapolating past trends in the components outlined in the foregoing can be expected to provide a reasonable initial estimate of the future growth trend. This forecast should then be adjusted to reflect observable information indicating how future patterns are likely to differ from past patterns. This same approach can 
be applied to less developed markets. It must be recognized, however, that these 
economies are likely to be undergoing rapid structural changes that may require the analyst to make more significant adjustments relative to past trends.
Anchoring Asset Returns to Trend Growth
Both theory and empirical evidence indicate that the average level of real (nominal) default-free bond yields is linked to the trend rate of real (nominal) growth.
9 To put 
it another way, bond yields will be pulled toward this level over time. Thus, the trend rate of growth provides an important anchor for estimating bond returns over hori-zons long enough for this reversion to prevail over cyclical and short-term forces. Intertemporal consistency demands that this anchor be factored into forecasts even for shorter horizons.
The trend growth rate also provides an anchor for long-run equity appreciation.10 
We can express the aggregate market value of equity, Ve, as the product of three 
factors: the level of nominal GDP , the share of profits in the economy, Sk (earnings/
GDP), and the P/E ratio (PE).
   V  t  e  =  GDP   t   ×  S  t  k  × P  E  t   
It is clear that over long periods, capital’s share of income cannot continually increase 
or decrease. The same is true for the P/E multiple applied to earnings. As a result, in 
the long run, the growth rate of the total value of equity in an economy is linked to the growth rate of GDP . Over finite horizons, the way in which the share of capital and the P/E multiple are expected to change will also affect the forecast of the total value of equity, as well as its corresponding growth rate over that period.
8 T otal factor productivity captures a variety of effects, such as the impact of adding not just more phys -
ical capital (i.e., “capital deepening”) but better capital, as well as the impact of increasingly skilled labor (i.e., increases in “human capital”). Earlier readings provide a more granular breakdown of the drivers/components of growth.9
 W
ith regard to nominal yields and growth, it is assumed that inflation is sufficiently well behaved.

This argument applies to the capital appreciation component of equity returns. 
It does not supply a way to estimate the other component: the dividend yield. An 
estimate for the dividend yield (annual dividends/market value) can be obtained by 
noting that the dividend yield equals the dividend payout ratio (dividends/profit) 
divided by the profit multiple (market value/profit). The analyst may set any two of these three ratios and infer the third.
EXAMPLE 8
Long-Run Equity Returns and Economic Growth
In January 2000, Alena Bjornsdottir, CFA, was updating her firm’s projections for US equity returns. The firm had always used the historical average return with little adjustment. Alena was aware that historical averages are subject to 
large sampling errors and was especially concerned about this fact because of the 
sequence of very high returns in the late 1990s, as well as over the past few years 
partly due to very low levels of interest rates. She decided to examine whether US 
equity returns since World War II had been consistent with economic growth. 
For the period 1946–2020, the continuously compounded (i.e., logarithmic) 
return was 10.7% per annum, which reflected the following components:
 
Real GDP 
Growth InflationEPS/GDP 
(Chg) P/E (Chg) Dividend Yield
2.9% 3.5% 0.00% 0.9% 3.4%
 
1. Wha t conclusion was Alena likely to have drawn from this analysis?
Guideline Answer:
Alena is likely have concluded that the post-war stock return exceeded what 
would have been consistent with growth of the economy. In particular, the rising P/E added 0.9% of “extra” return per year for 74 years, adding 67% (= 74 × 0.9%) to the cumulative, continuously compounded return and leaving the market 95% (exp[67%] = 1.95) above “fair value. ”
2.
 If s
he believed that in the long run that the US labor input would grow by 
0.9% per annum and labor productivity by 1.5%, that inflation would be 2.1%, that the dividend yield would be 2.25%, and that there would be no further growth in P/E, what is likely to have been her baseline projection for continuously compounded long-term US equity returns?
Guideline Answer:Her baseline projection is likely to have been 6.75% = 0.9% + 1.5% + 2.1% + 
2.25%.
3.
 In lig
ht of her analysis, how might she have adjusted her baseline projection?
Guideline Answer:
She is likely to have adjusted her projection downward to some degree to 
reflect the likelihood that the effect of the P/E would decline toward zero over time. Assuming, for example, that this would occur over 30 years would imply reducing the baseline projection by 2.2% = (67%/30) per year.

Approaches to Economic Forecasting 25
Studies have shown that countries with higher economic growth rates do not 
reliably generate higher equity market returns.11 A partial explanation is likely to 
be that the higher growth rate was already reflected in market prices. The sources 
of growth may be a second factor. Stock market returns ultimately reflect the rate of return on invested capital. If the capital stock is growing rapidly, the rate of return on invested capital may be driven down. Both of these explanations are consistent with 
the arguments outlined earlier. High growth need not translate one-for-one into higher 
return unless it can be expected to continue forever. Declining return on investment essentially means that either GDP growth slows or profits decline as a share of GDP , or both. And, of course, valuation multiples do matter.
APPROACHES TO ECONOMIC FORECASTING
compare major approaches to economic forecasting 
Whereas the trend growth rate is a long-term average and reflects only the supply side of 
the economy, most macroeconomic forecasting focuses on short- to intermediate-term 
fluctuations around the trend—that is, the business cycle. These fluctuations are usually 
ascribed primarily to shifts in aggregate demand, although shifts in the short-term aggregate supply curve also play a role.
Before discussing the business cycle, we outline the main approaches available for 
tracking and projecting these movements. There are at least three distinct approaches:
 ■Econometric models: the most formal and mathematical.
 ■Indicators: variables that lead, lag, or coincide with turns in the economy.
 ■Checklists: subjective integration of the answers to relevant questions.
These approaches are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, thorough analysis is likely 
to incorporate elements of all three.
Econometric Modeling
Econometrics is the application of statistical methods to model relationships among 
economic variables. Structural models specify functional relationships among variables 
based on economic theory. The functional form and parameters of these models are 
derived from the underlying theory. Reduced-form models  have a looser connection 
to theory. As the name suggests, some such models are simply more-compact rep-resentations of underlying structural models. At the other end of the spectrum are models that are essentially data driven, with only a heuristic rationale for selection of variables and/or functional forms.
Econometric models vary from small models with a handful of equations to large, 
complex models with hundreds of equations. They are all used in essentially the 
same way, however. The estimated system of equations is used to forecast the future values of economic variables, with the forecaster supplying values for the exogenous variables. For example, such a model may require the forecaster to enter exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices, and/or policy variables. The model then uses 
the estimated past relationships to forecast the future. It is important to consider that 
11 J oachim Klement, “What’s Growth Got to Do with It? Equity Returns and Economic Growth, ” Journal of Investing Summer 2015 is one such study covering 44 countries.5
© CFA Institute. For candidate use only. Not for distribution.
Learning Module 1  C apital Market Expectations, Part 1: Framework and Macro Considerations 26
the forecaster’s future values for the exogenous variables are themselves subject to 
estimation error. This fact will increase the variability of potential forecast errors of the endogenous variables beyond what results from errors in the estimated param-eter values. The analyst should examine a realistic range of values for the exogenous variables to assess the forecast’s sensitivity to these inputs.
Econometric models are widely regarded as very useful for simulating the effects 
of changes in key variables. The great merit of the econometric approach is that it constrains the forecaster to a certain degree of consistency and also challenges the modeler to reassess prior views based on what the model concludes. It does have 
important limitations, however. Econometric models require the user to find adequate 
measures for the real-world activities and relationships to be modeled. These measures 
may be unavailable. Variables may also be measured with error. Relationships among the variables may change over time because of changes in economic structure and/or because the model may have been based on faulty assumptions as to how the world works. As a result, the econometric model may be mis-specified. In practice, there-fore, skillful econometric modelers monitor the model’s recent forecasts for signs of 
systematic errors. Persistent forecast errors should ideally lead to a complete overhaul 
of the model. In practice, however, a more pragmatic approach is often adopted: Past forecast errors are incorporated into the model as an additional explanatory variable.
Economic Indicators
Economic indicators are economic statistics published by official agencies and/or private organizations. These indicators contain information on an economy’s recent past activity or its current or future position in the business cycle. Lagging economic 
indicators and coincident indicators reflect recent past and current economic activity, 
respectively. A leading economic indicator (LEI) moves ahead of the business cycle 
by a fairly consistent time interval. Most analysts focus primarily on leading indicators 
because they purport to provide information about upcoming changes in economic activity, inflation, interest rates, and security prices.
Leading indicator–based analysis is the simplest forecasting approach to use 
because it requires following only a limited number of statistics. It also has the 
advantage of not requiring the analyst to make assumptions about the path of exog-enous variables. Analysts use both individual LEIs and composite LEIs, reflecting a collection of economic data releases combined to give an overall reading. The OECD composite LEI for each country or region is based on five to nine variables such as share prices, manufacturing metrics, inflation, interest rates, and monetary data that exhibit cyclical fluctuations similar to GDP , with peaks and troughs occurring six to 
nine months earlier with reasonable consistency. Individual LEIs can also be combined 
into a so-called diffusion index, which measures how many indicators are pointing up and how many down. For example, if 7 out of 10 are pointing upward, then the odds are that the economy is accelerating.
One of the drawbacks of the (composite) leading indicator methodology is that 
the entire history may be revised each month. As a result, the most recently published 
historical indicator series will almost certainly appear to have fit past business cycles (i.e., GDP) better than it actually did in real time. This distortion is known as “look ahead” bias. Correspondingly, the LEI may be less reliable in predicting the current/next cycle than history suggests.
Business cycle indicators have been published for decades. A new methodology 
for tracking the business cycle, known generically as “nowcasting, ” emerged in the 
United States in the wake of the global financial crisis. The best-known of these 
forecasts, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s “GDPNow, ” was first published on 1 May 2014 for the second quarter of that year. The objective is to forecast GDP for the current quarter (which will not be released until after quarter-end) based on data

Approaches to Economic Forecasting 27
as it is released throughout the quarter. To do this, the Atlanta Fed attempts to use 
the same methodology and data as will be used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to estimate GDP , replacing data that has not yet been released with forecasts based on the data already observed. As the quarter progresses, more of the actual data will have been observed, and GDPNow should, at least on average, converge to what will be released by the BEA.
BEA RELEASES OF ESTIMATES 
The BEA releases a sequence of three GDP estimates for each quarter. The first, labeled the “advance” estimate, is released four weeks after the end of the quar -
ter and tends to have the greatest market impact. The “preliminary” estimate is 
released a month later, and the “final” estimate comes at the end of the following 
quarter. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow is actually a forecast of the BEA’s advance 
estimate, not of the final GDP release. Exhibit 3 compares the history of Atlanta 
Fed’s GDPNow model forecast with the actual GDP change.

It remains to be seen how useful nowcasting will be for investment analysts. It has 
a couple of clear advantages: It is updated in real time, and it is focused directly on a 
variable of primary interest (GDP and its components). Nowcasting is not designed to 
be predictive of anything beyond the end of the current quarter, however. In addition, 
it tends to be very volatile until a significant portion of the data for the quarter has been observed, at which point it may have lost some of its usefulness as a guide for investment decisions.
Checklist Approach
Formally or informally, many forecasters consider a whole range of economic data to assess the economy’s future position. Checklist assessments are straightforward 
but time-consuming because they require continually monitoring the widest possible 
range of data. The data may then be extrapolated into forecasts via objective statistical 
methods, such as time-series analysis, or via more subjective or judgmental means. An 
analyst may then assess whether the measures are in an equilibrium state or nearer to an extreme reading.

The subjectivity of the checklist approach is perhaps its main weakness. The 
checklist’s strength is its flexibility. It allows the forecaster to quickly take into account 
changes in economic structure by changing the variables or the weights assigned to 
variables within the analysis.

EXAMPLE 9
Approaches to Forecasting
Sara Izek and Adam Berke are members of the asset allocation committee at 
Cycle Point Advisors, which emphasizes the business cycle within its tactical 
asset allocation process. Berke has developed a time series model of the business 
cycle that uses a published LEI series as a key input. He presents forecasts based 
on the model at each asset allocation meeting. Izek is eclectic in her approach, preferring to sample research from a wide variety of sources each month and then focus on whatever perspectives and results seem most interesting. She usually brings a stack of charts she has copied to the asset allocation meeting.
Questions
1.
 Whic
h of the main forecasting approaches (or combination of approaches) 
best describe(s) each analyst’s own practice?
Guideline Answer:Berke uses the econometric modeling approach in conjunction with the LEI 
approach. Izek’s practice is essentially a checklist approach.
2.
 Wha
t strength(s) are likely to have appealed to each analyst?
Guideline Answer:
Berke is probably attracted to the quantitative output provided by a model, 
the consistency and discipline it imposes on the process, and the ability to generate explicit forecasts. He may have included the LEI in the model because it is designed to capture cyclical turning points or simply because doing so improves the model’s statistical fit of the model.Izek is probably drawn to the flexibility of the checklist approach with re-spect to what is included/excluded and how to evaluate the information.
3.
 Wha
t weaknesses might each analyst be overlooking?
Guideline Answer:
Berke may be overlooking potential mis-specification of his model, which is 
apt to make his forecasts systematically inaccurate (i.e., biased). He may also be failing to recognize the likely magnitude of the forecast errors that will be present even if the model is unbiased (i.e., overestimating the precision of the forecasts). By using the historical LEI series as an input to the model, he may be incorporating look-ahead bias into the model.Izek is likely overlooking the subjective, judgmental, and idiosyncratic nature of her approach.

BUSINESS CYCLE ANALYSIS, PHASES OF THE 
BUSINESS CYCLE AND MARKET EXPECTATIONS AND THE BUSINESS CYCLE
discuss how business cycles affect short- and long-term expectations 
The trend rate of economic growth provides a vital anchor for setting very long-run 
investment expectations, which in turn provide a starting point for developing pro-
jections over short- to intermediate-term horizons. Virtually by definition, deviations 
from trend wash out in the long run, making information about the current economic 
and market environment of limited value over very long horizons. Over short to 
intermediate horizons, however, such information can be very important. From a macroeconomic perspective, the most useful such information typically pertains to fluctuations associated with the business cycle.
It is useful to think of fluctuations in economic activity as a superposition of many 
cycles varying in frequency from very short (days) to very long (decades), each with stochastic amplitude. The business cycle is not a specific, well-defined cycle. It is the result of many intermediate frequency cycles that jointly generate most of the vari-ation in aggregate economic activity (i.e., GDP) around the trend. This fact explains 
why historical business cycles have varied in both duration and intensity—each was a 
different realization of a range of underlying stochastic cycles. It also helps to explain why it is difficult to project turning points in real time.
BUSINESS CYCLE PEAKS AND TROUGHS 
The best-known record of business cycle peaks and troughs is published for the 
United States by the National Bureau of Economic research (NBER). According 
to NBER, the United States has experienced 34 complete business cycles since 
1854, averaging 59 months from peak to peak. The longest cycle was 146 months, 
the shortest only 17 months. Fifty percent of the cycles lasted between 38 and 69 months. On average, the cycle’s contraction phase (peak to trough) lasted 17 months, whereas the expansion phase (trough to peak) lasted 42 months.
At a fundamental level, the business cycle arises in response to the interaction of 
uncertainty, expectational errors, and rigidities that prevent instantaneous adjustment 
to unexpected events. It reflects decisions that
a.
 ar
e made based on imperfect information and/or analysis with the expecta-
tion of future benefits,
b. r
equire significant current resources and/or time to implement, and
c.
 ar
e difficult and/or costly to reverse.
Such decisions are, broadly defined, investment decisions. Much of the uncer -
tainty that sustains the cycle is endogenous to the system. Competitors, suppliers, 
employers, creditors, customers, and policymakers do not behave as expected. Prices 
and quantities adjust more or less than expected. Other sources of uncertainty are more exogenous. Technological breakthroughs threaten to disrupt whole industries and/or create new ones. Fracking, gene sequencing, e-commerce, “big data, ” digital 
advertising, cybersecurity, 3-D printing, the internet of things, and driverless cars are 
among those now playing out. Weather patterns affect agriculture, construction, and 6

transportation. Natural disasters devastate local economies. Political and geopolitical 
shifts favor some entities and disadvantage others. And, of course, shocks in one part 
of the global economy are often transmitted to other parts of the world through trade 
relations, financial markets, and the prices of goods and services.
Numerous variables can be used to monitor the business cycle. Among them are 
GDP growth, industrial production (IP), employment/unemployment, purchasing 
managers indexes, orders for durable goods, the output gap (the difference between 
GDP estimated as if the economy were on its trend growth path and the actual value of GDP), and the leading indicator indexes discussed earlier.
Phases of the Business Cycle
There are various ways to delineate phases of the business cycle. The most obvious is to divide it into two primary segments (the expansion and the contraction) with two 
key turning points at which growth changes sign (the peak and the trough). These two 
periods are fairly easy to identify, at least in retrospect. Subdividing the cycle more finely is more ambiguous, even in retrospect, because it requires identifying more nuanced changes such as acceleration or deceleration of growth without a change in 
direction. Nonetheless, it is useful to divide the cycle into several phases distinguished 
through both economic and financial market characteristics. For the purpose of setting 
expectations for capital markets, we use five phases of the business cycle here: initial recovery, early expansion, late expansion, slowdown, and contraction. The first four occur within the overall expansion.
1.
 Initi
al recovery. This period is usually a short phase of a few months begin-
ning at the trough of the cycle in which the economy picks up, business con-fidence rises, stimulative policies are still in place, the negative output gap is large, and inflation is typically decelerating. Recovery is often supported by an upturn in spending on housing and consumer durables.
Capital market effects: Short-term rates and government bond yields are 
low. Bond yields may continue to decline in anticipation of further disinfla-tion but are likely to be bottoming. Stock markets may rise briskly as fears of a longer recession (or even a depression) dissipate. Cyclical assets—and risk -
ier assets, such as small stocks, higher-yield corporate bonds, and emerging market equities and bonds—attract investors and typically perform well.
2.
 E
arly expansion. The economy is gaining some momentum, unemployment 
starts to fall but the output gap remains negative, consumers borrow and spend, and businesses step up production and investment. Profits typically rise rapidly. Demand for housing and consumer durables is strong.
Capital market effects: Short rates are moving up as the central bank starts 
to withdraw stimulus put in place during the recession. Longer-maturity bond yields are likely to be stable or rising slightly. The yield curve is flatten-ing. Stocks trend upward.
3.
 L
ate expansion. The output gap has closed, and the economy is increasingly 
in danger of overheating. A boom mentality prevails. Unemployment is low, profits are strong, both wages and inflation are rising, and capacity pressures boost investment spending. Debt coverage ratios may deteriorate as balance sheets expand and interest rates rise. The central bank may aim for a “soft landing” while fiscal balances improve.
Capital market effects: Interest rates are typically rising as monetary policy 
becomes restrictive. Bond yields are usually rising, more slowly than short rates, so the yield curve continues to flatten. Private sector borrowing puts pressure on credit markets. Stock markets often rise but may be volatile as

nervous investors endeavor to detect signs of looming deceleration. Cyclical 
assets may underperform while inflation hedges such as commodities outperform.
4.
 Slowdow
n. The economy is slowing and approaching the eventual peak, 
usually in response to rising interest rates, fewer viable investment projects, and accumulated debt. It is especially vulnerable to a shock at this juncture. Business confidence wavers. Inflation often continues to rise as firms raise prices in an attempt to stay ahead of rising costs imposed by other firms doing the same.
Capital market effects: Short-term interest rates are high, perhaps still 
rising, but likely to peak. Government bond yields top out at the first clear sign of a slowing economy and may then decline sharply. The yield curve may invert, especially if the central bank continues to exert upward pressure on short rates. Credit spreads, especially for weaker credits generally widen. The stock market may fall, with interest-sensitive stocks such as utilities and “quality” stocks with stable earnings performing best.
5.
 Con
traction. Recessions typically last 12 to 18 months. Investment spend-
ing, broadly defined, typically leads the contraction. Firms cut production sharply. Once the recession is confirmed, the central bank eases monetary policy. Profits drop sharply. Tightening credit magnifies downward pressure on the economy. Recessions are often punctuated by major bankruptcies, incidents of uncovered fraud, exposure of aggressive accounting practices, or a financial crisis. Unemployment can rise quickly, impairing household financial positions.
Capital market effects: Short-term interest rates drop during this phase, as 
do bond yields. The yield curve steepens substantially. The stock market declines in the earlier stages of the contraction but usually starts to rise in the later stages, well before the recovery emerges. Credit spreads typically widen and remain elevated until signs of a trough emerge and it becomes apparent that firms will be able to roll over near-term debt maturities.
Exhibit 5 summarizes the fives phases of the business cycle, together with their 
impact on capital markets.

Business Cycle Analysis, Phases of the Business Cycle and Market Expectations and the Business Cycle 33
Market Expectations and the Business Cycle
This description of a typical business cycle may suggest that forming capital market 
expectations for short and intermediate horizons should be relatively straightforward. 
If an investor can identify the current phase of the cycle and correctly predict when the 
next phase will begin, is it not easy to make money? Unfortunately, it is not that simple.
First, the phases of the business cycle vary in length and amplitude. Recessions can 
be steep, and downturns (such as in the 1930s and in 2007–2009) can be frightening. 
On the other hand, recessions also can be short lived, with only a small decline in output and only a modest rise in unemployment. Sometimes, the weakest phase of the cycle does not even involve a recession but merely a period of slower economic growth or a “growth recession. ” Similarly, expansions vary in length and intensity.
Second, it is not always easy to distinguish between cyclical forces and secular 
forces acting on the economy and the markets. The prolonged recovery following the 
2007–2009 global financial crisis is a prime example. Interest rates and inflation went 
far lower and remained extraordinarily low far longer than virtually anyone would have predicted based on a purely cyclical view.
Third, although the connection between the real economy and capital market 
returns is strong, it is subject to substantial uncertainty. Capital market prices reflect a composite of investors’ expectations and attitudes toward risk with respect to all future horizons. How, when, and by how much the markets respond to the business cycle are as uncertain as the cycle itself—perhaps more so.
What does all of this variation and uncertainty imply for setting capital market 
projections? First, as with virtually any investment information, business cycle analysis 
generates a noisy signal with respect to prospective opportunities. Second, the signal 
is likely to be most reliable (a higher “signal-to-noise” ratio), and hence most valuable, 
over horizons within the range of likely expansion and contraction phases—perhaps one to three years. Returns over substantially shorter horizons are likely to be driven 
primarily by market reactions to more transitory developments, undermining the 
cycle’s predictive value. On the other hand, as the forecast horizon extends beyond this range, it becomes increasingly likely that one or more turning points will occur 
within the horizon, implying returns that increasingly reflect averaging over the cycle.
EXAMPLE 10
Cycles, Horizons, and Expectations
Lee Kim uses a statistical model that divides the business cycle into two “regimes”: 
expansion and contraction. The expected (continuously compounded) return on equities is +2% per month during expansions and −2% per month during 
contractions. Consistent with NBER’s historical record (see earlier sidebar), the 
probabilities of transitioning between regimes imply that expansions last 39 
months on average, whereas contractions average 20 months. Correspondingly, 
over the long run, the economy expands roughly two-thirds of the time and contracts one-third of the time. Hence, the long-term expected equity return is 
0.67% = [(2% × 2/3) + (−2% × 1/3)] per month, or 8% per year. Kim’s model indi -
cates that the economy recently transitioned into contraction. For the upcoming 
asset allocation committee meeting, he will prepare equity return forecasts for horizons of 3 months, 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years.

1. E xplain how you would expect the choice of time horizon to affect Kim’s 
projections.
Guideline Answer:The longer the horizon, the more likely that one or more transitions will 
occur between contraction and expansion; more generally, the more likely it is that the horizon spans more than one business cycle phase or even more than one full cycle. As a result, the longer the horizon, the more Kim’s fore-cast should reflect averaging over periods of expansion and contraction and the closer it will be to the “information-less” average of 8% per year.Over the next three months, it is highly likely that the economy will remain in contraction, so Kim’s forecast for that period should be very close to −2% per month [cumulatively −6%]. Because contractions last 20 months on av-erage in the model, Kim’s forecast for a one-year horizon should reflect only a modestly higher probability of having transitioned to expansion at some point within the period. So, his forecast might be −18% (an average of −1.5% per month) instead of −24% (−2% per month). Over a five-year horizon, it is very likely that the economy will have spent time in both contraction and expansion. As a result, Kim’s forecast will put significant weight on each phase. Because the economy starts in contraction (i.e., the starting point is not random), the weight on that phase will probably be somewhat higher than its long-term frequency of 1/3, say 0.40. This assumption implies a forecast of 4.8% per year [= 12 × [(0.6 × 2%) + (0.4 × −2%)]. Over a 10-year horizon, the frequency of expansion and contraction months is likely to be very close to the 2-to-1 long-run ratio. So, Kim’s forecast should be very close to 8% per year.
INFLATION AND DEFLATION: TRENDS AND 
RELATIONS TO THE BUSINESS CYCLE
explain the relationship of inflation to the business cycle and the 
implications of inflation for cash, bonds, equity, and real estate returns 
Until the early 20th century, the money supply was largely dictated by the supply of specie—gold and/or silver used in coins and to back bank deposits. Periods of both inflation and deflation were common. Today, currencies are backed by the credibility of governments and central banks rather than specie, and people expect the prices of goods and services to trend upward. Persistent deflation is rare. Expectation of an upward trend in prices reflects recognition of an asymmetry in a central bank’s so-called “reaction function. ” It is generally accepted that a central bank’s policy tools are more effective in slowing economic activity than in accelerating sluggish activity. 
Hence, central banks may tend to be more aggressive in combating downward pressure 
on demand than in reining in strong demand. In addition, it is widely believed that outright deflation damages the economy because it undermines:
 ■debt-financed investments. Servicing and repayment of nominally fixed debt becomes more onerous as nominal income flows and the nominal value of real assets both decline; and7

Inflation and Deflation: Trends and Relations to the Business Cycle 35
 ■the power of central banks. In a deflationary environment, interest rates fall 
to levels close to (or even below) zero. When interest rates are already very low, the central bank has less leeway to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates.
In contrast, moderate inflation is generally considered to impose only modest costs 
on the economy. Both the differential effectiveness of policy and the differential costs of 
inflation versus deflation suggest that central banks will, implicitly or explicitly, target 
positive inflation, and investors set their expectations accordingly. The result is that asset prices in general and bond yields in particular generally build in compensation for a positive average inflation rate.
Inflation is procyclical, accelerating in the later stages of the business cycle when 
the output gap has closed and decelerating when, during a recession or the early years 
afterward, there is a large output gap, which puts downward pressure on wages and prices. If the central bank’s target is credible, the average rate of inflation over the cycle should be near the target.
Because the cyclical pattern of inflation is well known, inflation expectations will 
also be procyclical. It is important, however, to differentiate inflation expectations by horizon. Very long-term inflation expectations should be virtually unaffected by 
cyclical fluctuations provided investors maintain confidence in the central bank’s tar -
get. Short horizon expectations will tend to have about the same amplitude as actual inflation. Inflation, and therefore inflation expectations, over intermediate horizons will be a blend of the different phases of the current and subsequent cycles. Hence, the amplitude of expectations will decline with horizon—again, provided investors do not lose confidence in the central bank’s target.
The pattern just described implies a “horizon structure” of inflation expectations 
that is countercyclical—upward sloping at the trough of the business cycle and 
inverted at the peak. Because inflation expectations are an important component of bond yields, this countercyclical pattern is one of the reasons that the yield curve’s slope is countercyclical.
12
To assess the effect of inflation on asset classes, we must consider both the cash 
flows and the discount rates. We consider “cash, ” nominal bonds, stocks, and real estate.
 ■Cash:  In this context, cash is taken to mean short-term interest-bearing 
instruments, not currency or zero-interest deposits. As long as short-term interest rates adjust with expected inflation, cash is essentially a zero-dura-tion, inflation-protected asset that earns a floating real rate. Inflation above or below expectation contributes to temporary fluctuations in the realized real return. Because central banks aim to stabilize actual and expected inflation, they tend to make the real rate on cash procyclical around a long-term level consistent with their target inflation rate. Hence, cash is relatively attractive (unattractive) in a rising (declining) rate environment. Deflation may make cash particularly attractive if a zero-lower-bound is binding on the nominal interest rate. Otherwise deflation is simply a component of the required short-term real rate.
 ■Bonds: Because the cash flows are fixed in nominal terms, the effect of inflation is transmitted solely through the discount rates (i.e., the yield curve). Rising (falling) inflation induces capital losses (gains) as the expected inflation component of yields rises (falls). If inflation remains within the expected cyclical range, shorter-term yields rise/fall more than longer yields but have less price impact as a result of shorter duration. If, however, 
12 A s will be discussed later, compensation for taking duration risk (the “term premium”) is procyclical. As a result, an inverted “horizon structure” of expected inflation does not necessarily imply an inverted yield curve.

Learning Module 1  C apital Market Expectations, Part 1: Framework and Macro Considerations 36
inflation moves out of the expected range, longer-term yields may rise/fall 
more sharply as investors reassess the likelihood of a change in the long-run average level of inflation. Persistent deflation benefits the highest-quality bonds because it increases the purchasing power of the cash flows, but it is likely to impair the creditworthiness of lower-quality debt.
 ■Stocks: As long as inflation stays within the expected cyclical range, there should be little effect on stocks because both expected future cash flows (earnings and dividends) and associated discount rates rise/fall in line with the horizon structure of inflation expectations. Signs that inflation is moving out of the expected range, however, indicate a potential threat. Unexpectedly high and/or rapidly rising inflation could mean that the cen-tral bank needs to act to slow the economy, whereas very low and/or falling inflation (possibly deflation) threatens a recession and a decline in asset prices. Within the stock market, higher inflation benefits firms that are able to pass along rising costs, whereas deflation is especially detrimental for asset-intensive, commodity-producing, and/or highly leveraged firms.
 ■Real estate: Short- to intermediate-term nominal cash flows are gener -
ally dictated by existing leases, with the speed of adjustment depending on the type of real estate asset held. As long as inflation remains within the expected range, renewal of leases will likely generate rental income rising with expected inflation, accompanied by stable asset values. Higher-than-expected inflation is likely to coincide with high demand for real estate, expectations that rental income will rise even faster than general inflation, and rising property values. The impact may be quite idiosyncratic, however, depending on the length of leases, the existing supply of similar properties, and the likelihood of new supply hitting the market when leases come up for renewal. On the other hand, unexpectedly low inflation (or deflation) will put downward pressure on expected rental income and prop-erty values, especially for less-than-prime properties, which may have to cut rents sharply to avoid rising vacancies.
EXAMPLE 11
Inflation
1. K esia Jabari believes the quantitative easing undertaken by major central 
banks in the wake of the global financial crisis is finally about to induce a surge in inflation. She believes that without extraordinary policy actions from the central banks, the inflation rate will ultimately rise to the upper end of central banks’ tolerance ranges at the peak of the current business cycle.

yield curve should flatten because long-term inflation expectations 
should remain well anchored. Floating-rate instruments (cash) will be relatively attractive, and intermediate maturities (“the belly of the curve”) will be the most vulnerable. In general, the rise in inflation should not have much independent impact on stocks or real estate because both cash flows and discount rates will be expected to rise. Firms with pricing power and real estate with relatively short lease-re-newal cycles are set to perform best.
b.
 If t
he market doubts that central banks can contain inflation within 
previously perceived tolerances, then long-run inflation expectations will rise and the yield curve may steepen rather than flatten, at least initially. Floating-rate instruments will still be relatively attractive, but now it is the longest maturities that will be the most vulnerable. Stocks are likely to suffer because the market expects central banks to be aggressive in fighting inflation. Real estate with long-term leases and little long-term, fixed-rate debt will suffer. Real estate with sub-stantial long-term, fixed-rate debt should do relatively well, especially high-quality properties with little new supply nearby, which are likely to avoid significant vacancies even in a recession.
In the interest of completeness, we should note a caveat before leaving the topic 
of inflation. The preceding discussion implicitly assumes that the short-run aggregate 
supply curve is upward sloping and that the business cycle is primarily driven by fluctuations in aggregate demand. Together, these assumptions imply that inflation is pro-cyclical. Although globalization may have reduced the sensitivity of domestic prices to domestic output, it seems unlikely that domestic output/growth no longer matters. Thus, the aggregate supply curve may be flatter but is unlikely to be flat. 
With regard to what drives the cycle, if aggregate supply shocks predominate, then inflation will tend to be countercyclical, reflecting alternating periods of “stagflation” 
and disinflationary boom. The 1970s oil crisis is a prime example. This pattern is more 
likely to be the exception rather than the rule, however.
ANALYSIS OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES
discuss the effects of monetary and fiscal policy on business cycles
Actual and anticipated actions by monetary and fiscal authorities affect the decisions and actions of all other participants in the economy and the markets. As a result, it is somewhat difficult to isolate their role(s) from our broader discussion. Indeed, the 
foregoing sections have made numerous references to these policies. Nonetheless it is 
worthwhile to focus directly on these policies from the perspective of setting capital market expectations.
Monetary policy is often used as a mechanism for intervention in the business 
cycle. Indeed, this use is inherent in the mandates of most central banks to maintain price stability and/or growth consistent with the economy’s potential. Each central bank interprets its mandate somewhat differently, sets its own operational objectives and guidelines, and selects its own mix of the tools (e.g., policy rates and liquidity 
provision) at its disposal. The common theme is that central banks virtually always aim 
to moderate the cyclical behavior of growth and inflation, in both directions. Thus, monetary policy aims to be countercyclical. The impact of monetary policy, however, 8

Learning Module 1  C apital Market Expectations, Part 1: Framework and Macro Considerations 38
is famously subject to “long and variable lags, ” as well as substantial uncertainty. As a 
result, a central bank’s ability to fine-tune the economy is limited, and there is always risk that policy measures will exacerbate rather than moderate the business cycle. This risk is greatest at the top of the cycle, when the central bank may overestimate the economy’s momentum and/or underestimate the effects of restrictive policies. In 
such situations, monetary policy may trigger a contraction that it cannot immediately 
counteract. In contrast, expansionary monetary policy rarely, if ever, suffices to turn a contraction into a strong recovery. This asymmetry is captured in a classic analogy: Expansionary policy is like “pushing” on a string, whereas restrictive policy is like “pulling” on a string.
Fiscal policy (government spending and taxation) can also be used to counteract 
cyclical fluctuations in the economy. Aside from extreme situations, however—such as 
the Great Depression of the 1930s and recovery from the 2007–2009 global financial crisis—fiscal policy typically addresses objectives other than regulating short-term growth, for at least two main reasons. First, in all but the most authoritarian regimes, 
the fiscal decision-making process is too lengthy to make timely adjustments to aggre -
gate spending and taxation aimed at short-term objectives. Second, frequent changes 
of a meaningful magnitude would be disruptive to the ongoing process of providing and funding government services.
Notwithstanding these considerations, fiscal policy often does play a role in 
mitigating cyclical fluctuations. Progressive tax regimes imply that the effective tax rate on the private sector is pro-cyclical—rising as the economy expands and falling as the economy contracts. Similarly, means-based transfer payments vary inversely with the economy, helping to mitigate fluctuations in disposable income for the most vulnerable households. The effect of these so-called automatic stabilizers should not be overlooked in setting expectations for the economy and the markets.
From the perspective of an investment analyst focused on establishing expectations 
for broad asset classes, having a handle on monetary policy is mission-critical with 
respect to cyclical patterns. Under normal conditions, fiscal adjustments are important 
but likely to be secondary considerations. The reverse is likely with respect to assessing 
the long run. Of course, if a major change in fiscal stance is contemplated or has been 
implemented, the impact warrants significant attention with respect to all horizons. The major overhaul of the US tax code (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) at the end of 2017 
is a good example of these points. Among the main provisions of this tax code change 
was a corporate tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% and a one-time reduced tax rate 
for US corporations’ foreign earnings if these earnings held in off-shore cash accounts 
are repatriated to on-shore accounts. These were significant changes with an impact 
on how US-based global firms handled their foreign earnings. It almost certainly 
provided a short-term stimulus, especially with respect to capital expenditures. But it was not a short-term policy adjustment. It was the most significant change to the tax code in decades, a major structural change that may affect the path of both the economy and the markets for many years.
Monetary Policy
Central banks can, and do, carry out their mandates somewhat differently. In general, 
they seek to mitigate extremes in inflation and/or growth via countercyclical policy measures. As a generic illustration of how this might work, we briefly review the Taylor rule. In the current context, it can be viewed as a tool for assessing a central bank’s stance and a guide to predicting how that stance is likely to evolve.
In essence, the Taylor rule links a central bank’s target short-term nominal interest 
rate to the expected growth rate of the economy and inflation, relative to trend growth 
and the central bank’s inflation target.

The rule can be re-expressed in terms of the real, inflation-adjusted target rate by 
moving the expected inflation rate to the left-hand side of the equation.
   i   *  −  π  e   =  r  neutral    + 0.5  (   ˆ Y    e   −    ˆ Y    trend  )  + 0.5  ( π  e   −  π  target  )  
F
rom this rearrangement, we see that the real, inflation-adjusted policy rate deviates 
from neutral by one-half the amount by which growth and inflation deviate from 
their respective targets. As an example, suppose the neutral real policy rate is 2.25%, the target inflation rate is 2%, and trend growth is estimated to be 2.5%. If growth is expected to be 3.5% and inflation is expected to be 3%, the Taylor rule would call for a 6.25% nominal policy rate:
 2.25% 
+ 3% + 0.5 (3.5% − 2.5%) + 0.5 (3.0% − 2.0%) = 6.25%.
With expected inflation at 3%, this calculation corresponds to a 3.25% real policy rate.
Even if a central bank were to set its policy rate according to the Taylor rule, there 
could still be substantial judgment left in the process. None of the inputs to the rule 
are objectively observable. To make the rule operational, policymakers and their staffs 
have to specify how the requisite expectations will be generated, and by whom. Whose 
estimate of trend growth is to be used? What is the appropriate neutral real policy rate? Over what horizon(s) do the expectations apply? Models could be developed to answer all these questions, but there would be judgments to be made in doing so. The upshot for the investment analyst is that monetary policy cannot be reduced to a simple equation. The Taylor rule, or some customized variant, provides a good framework for analyzing the thrust and likely evolution of monetary policy, but the analyst must pay careful attention to situational signals from the central bank. This is why, for example, the investment community literally scrutinizes every word in the Federal Reserve’s post-meeting statements and speeches by officials, looking for any hint of a change in the Fed’s own interpretation of the environment.

investment officer (CIO) has asked Grant to put together a projection of the 
likely path of policy rates for the next five years. 
Guideline Answer:A countercyclical response can be expected from both monetary and fiscal 
policy. Assuming the central bank uses a policy rate target as its primary tool, it will cut that rate. On the fiscal side, there may be no explicit expan-sionary policy action (tax cut or spending increase), but automatic stabi-lizers built into tax and transfer programs can be expected to cushion the shock’s impact on private sector disposable incomes.

Rule, what other information will he need in order to project the path of policy rates?
Guideline Answer:Grant will need to know what values the central bank uses for the neutral 
real rate, trend growth rate, and inflation target. He will also need to know how the central bank forms its expectations of growth and inflation. Finally, he will need to know how growth and inflation are likely to evolve, including how they will be affected by the path of policy rates.
3.
 Wha
t pattern should Grant expect for growth, inflation, and market interest 
rates if the central bank does not respond to the shock?
Guideline Answer:The deflationary shock is very likely to induce a contractionary phase of the 
business cycle, putting additional downward pressure on growth and infla-tion. Short-term market interest rates will be dragged downward by weak demand and inflation. Risky asset prices are likely to fall sharply. A deep and/or protracted recession may be required before conditions conducive to recovery are in place. Grant should therefore expect a deep “U-shaped” path for growth, inflation, and short-term rates.
4.
 A
ssuming the central bank does respond and that its reaction function is 
well approximated by the Taylor Rule, how will this alter Grant’s expecta-tions regarding the paths of growth, inflation, and short-term rates over the next five years?
Guideline Answer:If the central bank responds as expected, it will push short-term rates down 
farther and faster than they would otherwise fall in an effort to mitigate the downward momentum of growth and inflation. If the central bank correct-ly calibrates its policy, growth and inflation should decline less, bottom out sooner, and recover more quickly toward trend growth and the target inflation level, respectively, than in the absence of a policy response. Where-as the central bank is virtually certain to drive short rates down farther and faster, it may be inclined to let the market dictate the pace at which rates eventually rise. That is, it may simply “accommodate” the need for higher rates rather than risk unduly restraining the recovery once it is established.

What Happens When Interest Rates Are Zero or Negative? And Implications of Negative Rates for Capital Market Expectations 41
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN INTEREST RATES ARE ZERO 
OR NEGATIVE? AND IMPLICATIONS OF NEGATIVE 
RATES FOR CAPITAL MARKET EXPECTATIONS
discuss the effects of monetary and fiscal policy on business cycles
Prior to the 2007–2009 global financial crisis, it was generally accepted that central 
banks could not successfully implement negative interest rate policies. Belief in a “zero 
lower bound” on policy rates assumed that individuals would choose to hold currency 
(coins and notes) if faced with earning a negative interest rate on short-term instru-
ments, including deposits. The move toward holding currency would drain deposits and reserves from the banking system, causing bank balance sheets to shrink. The resulting credit contraction would put upward pressure on interest rates, thwarting 
the central bank’s attempt to maintain negative rates. The contraction of credit would 
likely also put additional downward pressure on economic growth, thereby reinforcing 
the need for stimulative policies.
This line of reasoning raised questions about the effectiveness of traditional mon -
etary policy when the economy is so weak that economic growth fails to respond to (nominal) interest rates approaching zero. Following the global financial crisis, as well as after the COVID-19 pandemic began, central banks faced with this situation pursued less conventional measures.
One important measure was quantitative easing, in which central banks committed 
to large-scale, ongoing purchases of high-quality domestic fixed-income securities. These purchases were funded by creating an equally large quantity of bank reserves in the form of central bank deposits. As a result of QE, central bank balance sheets and bank reserves grew significantly and sovereign bond yields fell. QE was pursued by (among others) the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England.
Conventional reasoning suggests that QE should have resulted in the desired 
growth in nominal spending. In theory, banks could use the increased reserves to extend loans, and low interest rates would stimulate businesses and households to borrow. The borrowing was expected to fund capital expenditure by businesses as well as current consumption and purchases of durables (e.g., houses and cars) by households, thereby stimulating the economy. With interest rates low, investors were expected to bid up the prices of stocks and real estate. Although asset prices did 
increase and businesses that could issue bonds borrowed heavily, proceeds were more 
often used to fund dividends and stock buybacks rather than capital expenditures. At the same time, household spending ability was significantly curtailed by the legacy of the global financial crisis.
Whether or not QE was effective remains subject to debate. To achieve desired 
levels of economic growth, central banks tried the previously unthinkable: targeting negative interest rates. The central banks of Denmark, Sweden, Japan, Switzerland, and the euro area were among those that adopted negative policy rates. Contrary to the notion of a “zero lower bound, ” negative policy rates proved to be sustainable. As of November 2021, 23% of the 1,744 bonds in the Bloomberg Global Aggregate 
Treasuries Index had negative nominal yield to maturity. These bonds represent 27% of 
the index’s market value. The issuers of such bonds are governments in the eurozone, as well as Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, and Japan.9

Learning Module 1  C apital Market Expectations, Part 1: Framework and Macro Considerations 42
The move into currency did not occur as expected because the scale and speed of 
transactions inherent in modern economies cannot be supported using physical cash as 
the primary method of exchange.13 Trillions of dollars change hands daily to facilitate 
trade in goods, services, and financial instruments, and these transactions cannot be 
accomplished using physical cash. Bank deposits and bank reserves held at the central 
bank, rather than as vault cash, have an implicit yield or convenience value that cash 
does not. As long as this value exceeds the explicit cost of holding those deposits—in the form of a negative interest rate—there is no incentive to convert deposits into cash. In such circumstances, negative policy rates may be achievable and sustainable.
In theory, using negative nominal rates to stimulate an economy should work 
similarly to using low but still positive rates. Businesses and consumers are encour -
aged to hold fewer deposits for transaction purposes; investors are encouraged to seek higher expected returns on other assets; consumers are encouraged to save less and/or borrow more against future income; businesses are encouraged to invest in 
profitable projects; and banks are encouraged to use their reserves in support of larger 
loan books. All of this is expected to stimulate economic growth.
For consumers, investors, businesses, and banks to behave as described, however, 
each must believe they will be adequately rewarded for taking the inherent risks. In a negative interest rate environment, these entities are likely to have greater levels of uncertainty as to whether they will be adequately compensated for risks taken, and therefore they may not act as desired by monetary policy makers. As a result, the effectiveness of expansionary monetary policy is more tenuous at low and negative interest rate levels than at higher interest rate levels.
Implications of Negative Interest Rates for Capital Market 
Expectations
Long-run capital market expectations typically take the level of the “risk-free rate” as 
a baseline to which various risk premiums are added to arrive at long-run expected 
returns for risky assets such as long-term bonds and equities. The implicit assumption 
is that the risk-free rate is at its long-term equilibrium level. When short-term rates are negative, the long-run equilibrium short-term rate can be used as the baseline rate in these models instead of the observed negative rate. This rate can be estimated using the neutral policy rate (r
neutral ) in the Taylor rule (or more generally in the 
central bank’s presumed reaction function), adjusted for a modest spread between policy rates and default-free rates available to investors.
In forming capital market expectations for shorter time horizons, analysts and 
investors must consider the expected path of interest rates. Paths should be considered 
that, on average, converge to the long-run equilibrium rate estimate. With negative policy rates in place, this approach means a negative starting point. In theory, many 
possible scenarios, each appropriately weighted by its likelihood, should be considered. 
In practice, it may suffice to consider only a few scenarios. Because shorter horizons 
provide less opportunity for the impact of events to average out, the shorter the forecast 
horizon, the more important it is to consider deviations from the most likely path.
Negative policy rates are expected to produce asset class returns similar to those 
occurring in the contraction and early recovery phases of a “more normal” business/
policy cycle. Although such historical periods may provide a reasonable starting point 
13 I t should also be noted that banks were reluctant to directly impose negative rates on their retail and 
commercial deposit customers. In general, rates on these accounts remained non-negative. Thus, the aggre -
gate incentive to move into cash was mitigated somewhat. Various fees (e.g., for overdraft protection) and conditions imposed on the accounts (e.g., compensating balance requirements), however, may still have resulted in a net cost for deposit customers.

The Monetary and Fiscal Policy Mix and the Shape of the Yield Curve and the Business Cycle 43
in formulating appropriate scenarios, it is important to note that negative rate peri-
ods may indicate severe distress in the economy and thus involve greater uncertainty regarding the timing and strength of recovery.
Key considerations when forming capital market expectations in a negative interest 
rate environment include the following:
 ■Historical data are less likely to be reliable.
 ●Useful data may exist on only a few historical business cycles, which may not include instances of negative rates. In addition, fundamental structural/institutional changes in markets and the economy may have occurred since this data was generated.
 ●Quantitative models, especially statistical models, tend to break down in situations that differ from those on which they were estimated/calibrated.
 ●Forecasting must account for differences between the current environ-ment and historical averages. Historical averages, which average out dif -
ferences across phases of the cycle, will be even less reliable than usual.
 ■The effects of other monetary policy measures occurring simultaneously (e.g., quantitative easing) may distort market relationships such as the shape of the yield curve or the performance of specific sectors.
Incorporating uncertain dynamics, including negative interest rates, into capi-
tal market expectations over finite horizons is much more difficult than projecting long-term average levels. The challenge arises from the fact that asset prices depend not only on investor expectations regarding longer term “equilibrium” levels but also on the path taken to get there.
THE MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY MIX AND THE 
SHAPE OF THE YIELD CURVE AND THE BUSINESS 
CYCLE
discuss the effects of monetary and fiscal policy on business cycles
interpret the shape of the yield curve as an economic predictor 
and discuss the relationship between the yield curve and fiscal and monetary policy
Fiscal policy is inherently political. Central banks ultimately derive their powers from 
governments, but most strive to be, or at least appear to be, independent of the polit -
ical process in order to maintain credibility. As a result, to the extent that monetary and fiscal policy are coordinated, it is usually the case that the central bank takes the expected fiscal stance as given in formulating its own policy and disdains guidance from politicians regarding its policy.
The mix of monetary and fiscal policies has its most apparent impact on the 
level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve. We first consider the effect of persistently loose or tight policies on the average level of rates. All else the same, loose fiscal policies (large deficits) increase the level of real interest rates because the domestic private sector must be induced to save more/investing less and/or addi-tional capital must be attracted from abroad. Conversely, tight fiscal policies reduce 10

real rates. Persistently loose monetary policy generally results in higher actual and 
expected inflation. Attempts by the central bank to hold down nominal rates will prove 
self-defeating, ultimately resulting in higher rather than lower nominal interest rates.14 
Conversely, persistently tight monetary policy ultimately reduces actual and expected 
inflation resulting in lower, rather than higher, nominal rates. Exhibit 6 summarizes 
the impact of persistent policy mixes on the level of real and nominal rates. In each case, the impact on real rates and on expected inflation is clear. Two cases involve a mix of loose and tight policy. In these cases, the combined impact could be higher or lower nominal rates. Nominal rates are labelled as “mid” level for these cases.

The second impact of policy is on the slope of the yield curve. The slope of the term 
structure of (default-free) interest rates depends primarily on (1) the expected future 
path of short-term rates and (2) a risk premium required to compensate for the 
greater price volatility inherent in longer-maturity bonds. The maturity premium 
explains why the term structure is normally upward sloping. Changes in the curve’s slope—flattening and steepening—are primarily driven by the evolution of short rate 
expectations, which are mainly driven by the business cycle and policies. This dynamic 
was described in an earlier discussion on business cycles. Exhibit 7 summarizes the main points regarding the evolution of rates, policy, and the yield curve.

There is a third factor related to monetary and fiscal policy that may, or may not, be 
significant with respect to the shape of the yield curve and the effectiveness of pol-icy: the relative supply of (government) bonds at various maturities. Does it matter what maturities the government issues in order to fund deficits? Does it matter what maturities the central bank chooses to buy/sell in its open market operations or its quantitative easing? There is no clear answer. The issue became important, however, in the wake of the global financial crisis for at least two reasons.
First, although it is now apparent that there is no clear lower bound on nominal 
interest rates, the effectiveness of conventional interest rate policies at very low 
rate levels remains in question. In particular, the central bank’s ability to influence long-term rates may be even more tenuous than usual. Second, governments have run, and continue to run, large deficits while quantitative easing by major central banks has caused them to accumulate massive holdings of government debt (and other securities), which they may ultimately need or want to sell. If relative supply of

Learning Module 1  C apital Market Expectations, Part 1: Framework and Macro Considerations 46
debt along the yield curve really matters, then how governments fund their deficits 
in the future and how the central banks manage the maturity of their holdings could have significant implications for the yield curve and the broader financial markets.
It is difficult to draw firm conclusions with respect to maturity management. The 
existing evidence in conjunction with broader observation of markets, however, sug-gests the following: Sufficiently large purchases/sales at different maturities are likely to have a meaningful effect on the curve while they are occurring, but the effect is unlikely to be sustained for long once the buy/sell operation ends. To put it another 
way, a sufficiently large flow of supply may have a noticeable impact on relative yields, 
but discrete changes in the quantity of each maturity outstanding are much less likely 
to have a lasting impact. Government bonds are very liquid, and investors can and do move up and down the yield curve to exploit even very small yield differentials. 
Having said that, an important caveat pertaining to very long maturities is appropriate. 
Pension funds and other entities with very long-dated liabilities need correspondingly 
very long-maturity assets. Severely limiting the available supply of those assets would 
undoubtedly drive down their yield. Low yields at the very long end of the UK yield curve have been attributed to this effect at various times.
As a final comment on the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy, we acknowledge 
the potential for politicization of the central bank. If the level of government debt is high relative to the economy (GDP), and especially if it is also rising because of large fiscal deficits, there is a risk that the central bank may be coerced into inflating away the real value of the debt with very accommodative monetary policy. The risk that 
this dynamic may  subsequently occur is almost certain to steepen the yield curve. If it 
does occur, such an event is likely to lead to an inflationary spiral, as higher inflation leads to higher nominal rates, which lead to faster accumulation of debt, which call forth even more accommodative monetary policy, and so on.
The Shape of the Yield Curve and the Business Cycle
The shape of the yield curve is frequently cited as a predictor of economic growth and 
as an indicator of where the economy is in the business cycle. Both casual observation 
and formal econometric analysis support its usefulness (an extensive bibliography is available at www
 .ne
wyorkfed
 .or
g). The underlying rationale was summarized earlier 
in Exhibit 7. In simplest terms, the curve tends to be steep at the bottom of the cycle, flatten during the expansion until it is very flat or even inverted at the peak, and re-steepen during the subsequent contraction. Because expectations with respect to 
the path of short-term rates are the primary determinant of the curve’s shape, the shape 
of the curve contains information about how market participants perceive the state 
and likely evolution of the economy as well as the impact they expect policymakers to 
have on that path. Thus, the empirical link between the shape of the yield curve and subsequent growth passes the test set out earlier for a good model—there is a solid 
rationale for believing it should be predictive. One must, of course, be aware that very 
few macroeconomic variables are truly exogenous and very few endogenous variables 
are completely unaffected by the past. “ A” (shape of the yield curve) may predict “B” (growth next period), but it may also be the case that “B” predicts “ A” in the period 
after that. The point is that the analyst should be aware of the fact that both the shape 
of the yield curve and economic growth (i.e., the business cycle) are endogenous within 
the economy. This is not to suggest throwing out a useful relationship but merely a reminder to interpret results with care.

EXAMPLE 13
The Business Cycle and the Yield Curve
Camford’s quantitative analysis team helped Albert Grant incorporate the central 
bank’s reaction function into a reduced-form model of growth and inflation. 
With this model, he will be able to project the path of short-term rates in the wake of the deflationary shock described in Example 12. Camford’s CIO has now asked him to extend the analysis to project the path of bond yields as well.
1.
 Wha
t will Grant need in order to project the path of bond yields?
Guideline Answer:
Grant will need a model linking bond yields to the policy rate. In essence, he 
needs a model of the yield curve.
2.
 E
ven before he can undertake the formal analysis, a large client asks Grant 
to explain the likely implications for the yield curve. What can he say?
Guideline Answer:Following the deflationary shock, the economy is very likely to enter into 
the contraction phase of the business cycle. The central bank will be cutting the policy rate, perhaps sharply. Long-term yields could drop even faster initially as the market anticipates that policy, but then the curve will steepen as the central bank cuts rates because long-maturity yields will incorporate the expectation of short-term rates rising again once the economy gains suf-ficient traction. The curve will likely reach its steepest point near the trough of the policy cycle and then gradually flatten as the economy gains strength and the central bank begins to tighten policy.
INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS
identify and interpret macroeconomic, interest rate, and exchange rate linkages between economies
In general, the dependence of any particular country on international interactions is a function of its relative size and its degree of specialization. Large countries with diverse economies, such as the so-called G–7 (the United States, United Kingdom, 
Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and Canada), tend to be less influenced by developments 
elsewhere than smaller economies, such as Chile, whose output depends significantly 
on a few commodities like copper. Nonetheless, increasing globalization of trade, 
capital flows, and direct investment in recent decades has increased the importance of international interactions for nearly all countries.
Macroeconomic Linkages
Macroeconomic linkages between countries are expressed through their respective current and capital accounts. The current account reflects net exports of goods and services, net investment income flows, and unilateral transfers. The capital account, which for the purposes of this discussion also includes what is known as the financial 11

Learning Module 1  C apital Market Expectations, Part 1: Framework and Macro Considerations 48
account, reflects net investment flows for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)—purchase 
and sale of productive assets across borders—and Portfolio Investment (PI) flows 
involving transactions in financial assets. By construction, if a country has a surplus on current account, it must have a matching deficit on capital account, or vice versa. Anything that affects one account must induce an equal and opposite change in the other account.
A nation’s current and capital accounts are linked to the broader economy by the 
fact that net exports, virtually always the most significant component of the current account, contributes directly to aggregate demand for the nation’s output. National 
income accounting also implies the following important relationship among net exports 
(X − M), saving (S), investment (I), and the government surplus (T − G):
 (X 
− M) = (S − I) + (T − G).
Net exports always equal net private saving (the excess of domestic private saving 
over investment spending) plus the government surplus. Anything that changes 
net exports must also change net private saving, the government surplus, or both. Conversely, changes in either of these will be transmitted to the rest of the world 
through the current account. Of course, because the current account and capital 
accounts are mirror images, we can reverse all the signs in the foregoing equation and make corresponding statements about the capital account. A surplus on capital 
account is how a nation funds an excess of investment and government spending over 
domestic saving plus taxes.
There are four primary mechanisms by which the current and capital accounts 
are kept in balance: changes in income (GDP), relative prices, interest rates and asset prices, and exchange rates. Strictly speaking, all of these tools can play a role in both the real economy (the current account and FDI) and the financial markets, and they are determined simultaneously. However, markets do not all move at the same pace. In particular, investment markets adjust much more quickly than the real economy. In the short run, interest rates, exchange rates, and financial asset prices must adjust 
to keep the capital account in balance with the more slowly evolving current account. 
Meanwhile, the current account, in conjunction with real output and the relative prices 
of goods and services, tends to reflect secular trends and the pace of the business cycle.
EXAMPLE 14
International Macroeconomic Linkages
A large, diversified economy recently instituted a substantial tax cut, primarily 
aimed at reducing business taxes. Some provisions of the new law were designed 
to stem the tide of domestic firms moving production facilities abroad and 
encourage an increase in corporate investment in the domestic economy. There 
was no reduction in government spending. Prior to the tax cut, the country had 
both a current account deficit and a government deficit.

d. t he current and capital accounts of other countries?
Guideline Answer:
a.
 The defic
it on current account will almost certainly increase. The 
government deficit will increase which, all else the same, will result 
in a one-for-one increase in the current account deficit. If the tax cut works as intended, domestic investment will increase, reducing net private saving and further increasing the current account deficit. Private saving will increase as a result of rising income (GDP), which will diminish the impact on the current account somewhat. Unless saving increases by the full amount of the tax cut plus the increase in investment spending, however, the net effect will be an increase in the current account deficit. In principle, this increase could be thwarted by movements in the financial markets that make it impossible to fund it, but this is unlikely.
b.
 B
ecause the current account deficit will increase, the country’s capital 
account surplus must increase by the same amount. In effect, the tax cut will be funded primarily by borrowing from abroad and/or selling assets to non-domestic investors. Part of the adjustment is likely to come from a reduction in FDI by domestic firms (i.e., purchases of productive assets abroad) provided the new tax provisions work as intended.
c.
 Gr
owth in other countries is likely to increase as the tax cut stimulates 
demand for their exports and that increase in turn generates addi-tional demand within their domestic economies.
d.
 In t
he aggregate, other countries must already be running current 
account surpluses and capital account deficits matching the balances of the country that has cut taxes. Their aggregate current account surplus and capital account deficit will increase by the same amount as the increase in current account deficit and capital account surplus of the tax-cutting country.
2.
 Wha
t adjustments is the tax cut likely to induce in the financial markets?
Guideline Answer:
The country must attract additional capital flows from abroad. This endeav-
or is likely to be facilitated, at least in part, by the expectation of rising af-ter-tax profits resulting from the business taxes. Equity values should there-fore rise. The adjustment may also require interest rates and bond yields to rise relative to the rest of the world. The impact on the exchange rate is less clear. Because the current account and the capital account represent exactly offsetting flows, there is no a priori change in demand for the currency. The net impact will be determined by what investors expect to happen. (See the following section for a discussion of exchange rate linkages.)
Interest Rate/Exchange Rate Linkages
One of the linkages of greatest concern to investors involves interest rates and exchange 
rates. The two are inextricably linked. This fact is perhaps most evident in the prop-osition that a country cannot simultaneously
 ■allow unrestricted capital flows;
 ■maintain a fixed exchange rate; and

Learning Module 1  C apital Market Expectations, Part 1: Framework and Macro Considerations 50
 ■pursue an independent monetary policy.
The essence of this proposition is that if the central bank attempts to push interest 
rates down (up), capital will flow out (in), putting downward (upward) pressure on the 
exchange rate, forcing the bank to buy (sell) its own currency, and thereby reversing 
the expansionary (contractionary) policy. Carrying this argument to its logical con-clusion suggests that, with perfect capital mobility and a fixed exchange rate, “the” 
interest rate must be the same in countries whose currencies are pegged to each other.
Can we extend this proposition to encompass the whole (default-free) yield curve? 
Yes, but in doing so, we have to be somewhat more precise. Under what conditions 
would two markets share a yield curve? First, there must be unrestricted capital 
mobility between the markets ensuring that risk-adjusted expected returns will be equalized. The second condition is more difficult: The exchange rate between the currencies must be credibly fixed forever.
15 That is, investors must believe there is no 
risk that the currencies will exchange at a different rate in the future. Otherwise, yield 
differentials will emerge, giving rise to differential risk and return expectations in the two markets and allowing each market to trade on its own fundamentals. Thus, it is the lack of credibly fixed exchange rates that allows (default-free) yield curves, and hence bond returns, to be less than perfectly correlated across markets.
If a currency is linked to another without full credibility, then bond yields in the 
weaker currency are nearly always higher. This has been true even in the eurozone where, technically, separate currencies no longer exist—Greece, Italy, and Spain have always traded at meaningful, but varying, spreads over Germany and France. As long as there is no imminent risk of a devaluation, spreads at the very shortest maturities should be comparatively narrow. As demonstrated by the Greek exit (“Grexit”) cri-sis, however, the situation changes sharply when the market perceives an imminent threat of devaluation (or a withdrawal from the common currency). Spreads then widen throughout the curve, but especially at the shortest maturities, and the curve will almost certainly invert. Why? Because in the event of a devaluation, yields in the 
devaluing currency will decline sharply (as the currency-risk premium collapses), 
generating much larger capital gains on longer-term bonds and thereby mitigating more of the currency loss.
When the exchange rate is allowed to float, the link between interest rates and 
exchange rates is primarily expectational. To equalize risk-adjusted expected returns across markets, interest rates must generally be higher (lower) in a currency that is expected to depreciate (appreciate). Ironically, this dynamic can lead to seemingly 
perverse situations in which the exchange rate “overshoots” in one direction to gener -
ate the expectation of movement in the opposite direction. The expectational linkage 
among exchange rates, interest rates, and asset prices is covered in detail at a later stage.
Capital mobility alone is clearly insufficient to eliminate differences in nominal  
interest rates and bond yields across countries. To a greater or lesser extent, each market responds to its own fundamentals, including policies. But what about real  
yields? We need to look at this question from two perspectives: the financial markets and the real economy.
An investor cares about the real return that she expects to earn in her owncur -
rency. In terms of a non-domestic asset, what matters is the nominal return and the change in the exchange rate. Even if non-domestic interest rates remain unchanged, the real return earned by the investor will not equal the non-domestic real interest 
rate unless purchasing power parity (PPP) holds over the investor’s horizon. The 
empirical evidence overwhelmingly indicates that PPP does not hold over relevant

International Interactions 51
investment horizons. Hence, we cannot rely on the simplistic notion that real inter -
est rate differentials represent exploitable opportunities and should be eliminated by 
portfolio investment flows.
The preceding point is somewhat subtle and should not be construed to mean that 
real interest rate differentials are irrelevant for cross-market investment decisions. On 
the contrary, they can, but do not always, point to the likelihood of favorable nominal  
yield and exchange rate movements. The investor needs to assess non-domestic real rates from that perspective.
Ultimately, real interest rates must be consistent with the real saving and investment 
decisions that drive economic growth and the productivity of capital. As discussed 
earlier, saving and investment decisions are linked across countries through their 
current accounts. “Excess” saving in one country funds “excess” investment in another. 
In essence, there is a global market in which capital flows to where it is expected to 
be most productive. Although real rates around the world need not be equal, they are 
linked through the requirement that global savings must always equal global investment. 
Hence, they will tend to move together. As an example, the widespread low level of real 
interest rates that persisted in the aftermath of the global financial crisis was widely attributed to a very high level of global saving—primarily in Asia—and an unusually 
low level of capital investment in many developed markets, notably the United States.
SUMMARY
This is the first of two readings on how investment professionals should address the setting of capital market expectations. The reading began with a general framework 
for developing capital market expectations followed by a review of various challenges 
and pitfalls that analysts may encounter in the forecasting process. The remainder of the reading focused on the use of macroeconomic analysis in setting expectations. The following are the main points covered in the reading:
 ■Capital market expectations are essential inputs for strategic as well as tacti-cal asset allocation.
 ■The ultimate objective is a set of projections with which to make informed investment decisions, specifically asset allocation decisions.
 ■Undue emphasis should not be placed on the accuracy of projections for individual asset classes. Internal consistency across asset classes (cross-sectional consistency) and over various time horizons (intertemporal consistency) are far more important objectives.
 ■The process of capital market expectations setting involves the following steps:
1.
 S
pecify the set of expectations that are needed, including the time hori-
zon(s) to which they apply.
2.
 Re
search the historical record.
3.
 S
pecify the method(s) and/or model(s) that will be used and their infor -
mation requirements.
4.
 D
etermine the best sources for information needs.

terpret the current investment environment using the selected data 
and methods, applying experience and judgment.

 ■Among the challenges in setting capital market expectations are:
 ●limitations of economic data including lack of timeliness as well as 
changing definitions and calculations;
 ●data measurement errors and biases including transcription errors, sur -
vivorship bias, and appraisal (smoothed) data;
 ●limitations of historical estimates including lack of precision, nonstation-arity, asynchronous observations, and distributional considerations such as fat tails and skewness;
 ●ex post risk as a biased risk measure such as when historical returns reflect expectations of a low-probability catastrophe that did not occur or capture a low-probability event that did happen to occur;
 ●bias in methods including data-mining and time-period biases;
 ●failure to account for conditioning information;
 ●misinterpretation of correlations;
 ●psychological biases including anchoring, status quo, confirmation, over -
confidence, prudence, and availability biases.
 ●model uncertainty.
 ■Losing sight of the connection between investment outcomes and the economy is a fundamental, and potentially costly, mistake in setting capital market expectations.
 ■Some growth trend changes are driven by slowly evolving and easily observ -
able factors that are easy to forecast. Trend changes arising from exogenous shocks are impossible to forecast and difficult to identify, assess, and quan-tify until the change is well established.
 ■Among the most important sources of shocks are policy changes, new products and technologies, geopolitics, natural disasters, natural resources/critical inputs, and financial crises.
 ■An economy’s aggregate trend growth rate reflects growth in labor inputs and growth in labor productivity. Extrapolating past trends in these compo-nents can provide a reasonable initial estimate of the future growth trend, which can be adjusted based on observable information. Less developed economies may require more significant adjustments because they are likely to be undergoing more rapid structural changes.
 ■The average level of real (nominal) default-free bond yields is linked to the trend rate of real (nominal) growth. The trend rate of growth provides an important anchor for estimating bond returns over horizons long enough for this reversion to prevail over cyclical and short-term forces.
 ■The trend growth rate provides an anchor for long-run equity appreciation. In the very long run, the aggregate value of equity must grow at a rate very close to the rate of GDP growth.
 ■There are three main approaches to economic forecasting:
 ●Econometric models: structural and reduced-form statistical models of key variables generate quantitative estimates, impose discipline on fore-casts, may be robust enough to approximate reality, and can readily fore-cast the impact of exogenous variables or shocks. However, they tend to be complex, time-consuming to formulate, and potentially mis-specified, and they rarely forecast turning points well.

International Interactions 53
 ●Indicators: variables that lead, lag, or coincide with turns in the econ-
omy. This approach is the simplest, requiring only a limited number of published statistics. It can generate false signals, however, and is vulner -
able to revisions that may overfit past data at the expense of the reliabil-ity of out-of-sample forecasts.
 ●Checklist(s): subjective integration of information deemed relevant by the analyst. This approach is the most flexible but also the most subjec -
tive. It readily adapts to a changing environment, but ongoing collection and assessment of information make it time-consuming and also limit the depth and consistency of the analysis.
 ■The business cycle is the result of many intermediate frequency cycles that jointly generate most of the variation in aggregate economic activity. This explains why historical business cycles have varied in both duration and intensity and why it is difficult to project turning points in real time.
 ■The business cycle reflects decisions that (a) are made based on imperfect information and/or analysis with the expectation of future benefits, (b) require significant current resources and/or time to implement, and (c) are difficult and/or costly to reverse. Such decisions are, broadly defined, invest -
ment decisions.
 ■A typical business cycle has a number of phases. We split the cycle into five phases with the following capital market implications:
 ●Initial Recovery. Short-term interest rates and bond yields are low. Bond yields are likely to bottom. Stock markets may rise strongly. Cyclical/riskier assets such as small stocks, high-yield bonds, and emerging mar -
ket securities perform well.
 ●Early Expansion. Short rates are moving up. Longer-maturity bond yields are stable or rising slightly. Stocks are trending up.
 ●Late Expansion. Interest rates rise, and the yield curve flattens. Stock markets often rise but may be volatile. Cyclical assets may underperform while inflation hedges outperform.
 ●Slowdown. Short-term interest rates are at or nearing a peak. Government bond yields peak and may then decline sharply. The yield curve may invert. Credit spreads widen, especially for weaker credits. Stocks may fall. Interest-sensitive stocks and “quality” stocks with stable earnings perform best.
 ●Contraction. Interest rates and bond yields drop. The yield curve steep-ens. The stock market drops initially but usually starts to rise well before the recovery emerges. Credit spreads widen and remain elevated until clear signs of a cycle trough emerge.
 ■At least three factors complicate translation of business cycle information into capital market expectations and profitable investment decisions. First, the phases of the cycle vary in length and amplitude. Second, it is not always easy to distinguish between cyclical forces and secular forces acting on the economy and the markets. Third, how, when, and by how much the markets respond to the business cycle is as uncertain as the cycle itself—perhaps more so.
 ■Business cycle information is likely to be most reliable/valuable in setting capital market expectations over horizons within the range of likely expan-sion and contraction phases. Transitory developments cloud shorter-term

Learning Module 1  C apital Market Expectations, Part 1: Framework and Macro Considerations 54
forecasts, whereas significantly longer horizons likely cover portions of 
multiple cycle phases. Information about the current cyclical state of the economy has no predictive value over very long horizons.
 ■Monetary policy is often used as a mechanism for intervention in the business cycle. This mechanism is inherent in the mandates of most central banks to maintain price stability and/or growth consistent with potential.
 ■Monetary policy aims to be countercyclical, but the ability to fine-tune the economy is limited and policy measures may exacerbate rather than moder -
ate the business cycle. This risk is greatest at the top of the cycle when the central bank may overestimate the economy’s momentum and/or underesti-mate the potency of restrictive policies.
 ■Fiscal policy—government spending and taxation—can be used to coun-teract cyclical fluctuations in the economy. Aside from extreme situations, however, fiscal policy typically addresses objectives other than regulating short-term growth. So-called automatic stabilizers do play an important role in mitigating cyclical fluctuations.
 ■The Taylor Rule is a useful tool for assessing a central bank’s stance and for predicting how that stance is likely to evolve.
 ■The expectation that central banks could not implement negative policy rates proved to be unfounded in the aftermath of the 2007–2009 global financial crisis. Because major central banks combined negative policy rates with other extraordinary measures (notably quantitative easing), however, the effectiveness of the negative rate policy is unclear. The effectiveness of quantitative easing is also unclear.
 ■Negative interest rates, and the environment that gives rise to them, make the task of setting capital market expectations even more complex. Among the issues that arise are the following:
 ●It is difficult to justify negative rates as a “risk-free rate” to which risk premiums can be added to establish long-term “equilibrium” asset class returns.
 ●Historical data and quantitative models are even less likely to be reliable.
 ●Market relationships (e.g., the yield curve) are likely to be distorted by other concurrent policy measures.
 ■The mix of monetary and fiscal policies has its most apparent effect on the average level of interest rates and inflation. Persistently loose (tight) fiscal policy increases (reduces) the average level of real interest rates. Persistently loose (tight) monetary policy increases (reduces) the average levels of actual and expected inflation. The impact on nominal rates is ambiguous if one policy is persistently tight and the other persistently loose.
 ■Changes in the slope of the yield curve are driven primarily by the evolution of short rate expectations, which are driven mainly by the business cycle and policies. The slope of the curve may also be affected by debt management.
 ■The slope of the yield curve is useful as a predictor of economic growth and as an indicator of where the economy is in the business cycle.
 ■Macroeconomic linkages between countries are expressed through their respective current and capital accounts.
 ■There are four primary mechanisms by which the current and capital accounts are kept in balance: changes in income (GDP), relative prices, interest rates and asset prices, and exchange rates.

International Interactions 55
 ■In the short run, interest rates, exchange rates, and financial asset prices 
must adjust to keep the capital account in balance with the more slowly evolving current account. The current account, in conjunction with real output and the relative prices of goods and services, tends to reflect secular trends and the pace of the business cycle.
 ■Interest rates and currency exchange rates are inextricably linked. This relationship is evident in the fact that a country cannot simultaneously allow unfettered capital flows, maintain a fixed exchange rate, and pursue an inde-pendent monetary policy.
 ■Two countries will share a default-free yield curve if (and only if) there is perfect capital mobility and the exchange rate is credibly fixed forever. It is the lack of credibly fixed exchange rates that allows (default-free) yield curves, and hence bond returns, to be less than perfectly correlated across markets.
 ■With floating exchange rates, the link between interest rates and exchange rates is primarily expectational. To equalize risk-adjusted expected returns across markets, interest rates must be higher (lower) in a currency that is expected to depreciate (appreciate). This dynamic can lead to the exchange rate “overshooting” in one direction to generate the expectation of move-ment in the opposite direction.
 ■An investor cares about the real return that he or she expects to earn in his or her owncurrency. In terms of a foreign asset, what matters is the nominal  
return and the change in the exchange rate.
 ■Although real interest rates around the world need not be equal, they are linked through the requirement that global savings must always equal global investment. Hence, they will tend to move together.

Jennifer Wuyan is an investment strategist responsible for developing long-term capital market expectations for an investment firm that invests in domestic equi-ties. She presents a report to the firm’s investment committee describing the sta-tistical model used to formulate capital market expectations, which is based on a dividend discount method. In the report, she notes that in developing the model, she researched the historical data seeking to identify the relevant variables and determined the best source of data for the model. She also notes her interpreta-tion of the current economic and market environment.

 E
xplain what additional step(s) Wuyan should have taken in the process of setting 
capital market expectations. 
Wuyan reports that after repeatedly searching the most recent 10 years of data, 
she eventually identified variables that had a statistically significant relationship with equity returns. Wuyan used these variables to forecast equity returns. She documented, in a separate section of the report, a high correlation between nominal GDP and equity returns. Based on this noted high correlation, Wuyan concludes that nominal GDP predicts equity returns. Based on her statistical results, Wuyan expects equities to underperform over the next 12 months and recommends that the firm underweight equities.
Commenting on the report, John Tommanson, an investment adviser for the 
firm, suggests extending the starting point of the historical data back another 20 years to obtain more robust statistical results. Doing so would enable the analysis to include different economic and central bank policy environments. Tomman-son is reluctant to underweight equities for his clients, citing the strong perfor-mance of equities over the last quarter, and believes the most recent quarterly data should be weighted more heavily in setting capital market expectations.

Neshie Wakuluk is an investment strategist who develops capital market expecta-tions for an investment firm that invests across asset classes and global markets. Wakuluk started her career when the global markets were experiencing signifi-cant volatility and poor returns; as a result, she is now careful to base her conclu-sions on objective evidence and analytical procedures to mitigate any potential biases.
Wakuluk’s approach to economic forecasting utilizes a structural model in 
conjunction with a diffusion index to determine the current phase of a country’s business cycle. This approach has produced successful predictions in the past,

thus Wakuluk has high confidence in the predictions. Wakuluk also determines 
whether any adjustments need to be made to her initial estimates of the respec-tive aggregate economic growth trends based on historical rates of growth for Countries X and Y (both developed markets) and Country Z (a developing mar-ket). Exhibit 1 summarizes Wakuluk’s predictions:

Wakuluk assumes short-term interest rates adjust with expected inflation and 
are procyclical. Wakuluk reviews the historical short-term interest rate trends for each country, which further confirms her predictions shown in Exhibit 1.
Wakuluk decides to focus on Country Y to determine the path of nominal inter-
est rates, the potential economic response of Country Y’s economy to this path, and the timing for when Country Y’s economy may move into the next business cycle. Wakuluk makes the following observations:

Robert Hadpret is the chief economist at Agree Partners, an asset management firm located in the developed country of Eastland. He has prepared an economic report on Eastland for the firm’s asset allocation committee. Hadpret notes that the composite index of leading economic indicators has declined for three con-secutive months and that the yield curve has inverted. Private sector borrowing is also projected to decline. Based on these recent events, Hadpret predicts an economic contraction and forecasts lower inflation and possibly deflation over the next 12 months.

onitor actual outcomes and compare them with expectations, providing 
feedback to improve the expectation-setting process.
The first step, which specifies the set of expectations needed, is carried out by 
the firm. Wuyan, in developing a statistical model based on a dividend discount method, researched the historical data seeking to identify the relevant variables and determined the best source of data for the model. In her report, she also noted her interpretation of the current economic and market environment. To complete the process, Wuyan should complete Steps 6 and 7. Wuyan should pro-vide the set of expectations needed, documenting the conclusions, and include the reasoning and assumptions underlying the projections. Then, she should monitor the actual outcomes and compare them with the expectations, provid-ing feedback to assess and improve the accuracy of the process. The comparison of the capital market expectations estimated by the model against actual results provides a quantitative evaluation of forecast error. The feedback from this step can be used to improve the expectation-setting process.
2.
 Di
scuss  how each  of the following forecasting challenges evident in Wuyan’s 
report and in Tommanson’s comments affects the setting of capital market expectations:
Status quo bias Tommanson’s statement that he is reluctant to underweight equities 
given the strong performance of equities over the last quarter is an example of status quo bias. His statement that the most recent quar -
terly data should be weighted more heavily in setting capital market expectations is also an example of this bias. Status quo bias reflects the tendency for forecasts to perpetuate recent observations and for managers to then avoid making changes. Status quo bias can be miti-gated by a disciplined effort to avoid anchoring on the status quo.
Data-mining bias In Wuyan’s report, data-mining bias arises from repeatedly search-
ing a data set until a statistically significant pattern emerges. Such a pattern will almost inevitably occur, but the statistical relationship cannot be expected to have predictive value. As a result, the model-ing results are unreliable. Irrelevant variables are often included in the forecasting model. As a solution, the analyst should scrutinize the variables selected and provide an economic rationale for each variable selected in the forecasting model. A further test is to exam-ine the forecasting relationship out of sample.

Solutions 63
Risk of regime 
changeThe suggestion by Tommanson to extend the data series back increases the risk of the data representing more than one regime. A change in regime is a shift in the technological, political, legal, eco-nomic, or regulatory environments. Regime change alters the risk–return relationship since the asset’s risk and return characteristics vary with economic and market environments. Analysts can apply statistical techniques that account for the regime change or simply use only part of the whole data series.
Misinterpretation of correlationWuyan states that the high correlation between nominal GDP and equity returns implies nominal GDP predicts equity returns. This statement is incorrect since high correlation does not imply causation. In this case, nominal GDP could predict equity returns, equity returns could predict nominal GDP , a third variable could pre-dict both, or the relationship could merely be spurious. Correlation does not allow the analyst to distinguish between these cases. As a result, correlation relationships should not be used in a predictive model without understanding the underlying linkages between the variables.
3. The g rowth rate in the aggregate market value of equity is expressed as a sum 
of the following four factors: (1) growth rate of nominal GDP , (2) the change in 
the share of profits in GDP , (3) the change in P/E, and (4) the dividend yield. The growth rate of nominal GDP is the sum of the growth of real GDP and inflation. The growth rate of real GDP is estimated as the sum of the growth rate in the labor input and the growth rate in labor productivity. Based on the chief econ-omist’s estimates, the macroeconomic forecast indicates that nominal GDP will increase by 4.0% (= 0.5% labor input + 1.3% productivity + 2.2% inflation).
Assuming a 2.8% dividend yield and no change in the share of profits in the 
economy, Cambo’s forecast of a 9.0% annual increase in equity returns implies a 2.2% long-term contribution (i.e., 9.0% equity return − 4.0% nominal GDP − 2.8% dividend yield) from an expansion in the P/E.
4.
 
Discuss , based on the chief economist’s prediction, the implications for the following:
Bond yieldsIn the late expansion phase of the business cycle, bond yields are usu-
ally rising but more slowly than short-term interest rates are, so the yield curve flattens. Private sector borrowing puts upward pressure on rates while fiscal balances typically improve.
Equity returnsIn the late expansion phase of the business cycle, stocks typically rise but are subject to high volatility as investors become nervous about the restrictive monetary policy and signs of a looming economic slow -
down. Cyclical assets may underperform while inflation hedges, such as commodities, outperform.
Short-term inter -
est ratesIn the late expansion phase of the business cycle, short-term interest rates are typically rising as monetary policy becomes restrictive because the economy is increasingly in danger of overheating. The central bank may aim for a soft landing.

Learning Module 1  C apital Market Expectations, Part 1: Framework and Macro Considerations 64
Strengths• The leading indicator–based 
approach is simple since it requires following a limited number of economic/financial variables.  
• Can focus on individual or com-posite variables that are readily available and easy to track.  
• Focuses on identifying/forecast -
ing turning points in the business cycle.• Econometric models can be quite robust and can examine impact of many potential variables.  
• New data may be collected and con-sistently used within models to quickly generate output.  
• Models are useful for simulating effects of changes in exogenous vari-ables.  
• Imposes discipline and consistency on the forecaster and challenges mod-eler to reassess prior view based on model results.
Weaknesses• Data subject to frequent revi-sions resulting in “look-ahead” bias.  
• “Current” data not reliable as input for historical analysis.  
• Overfitted in sample. Likely overstates forecast accuracy.  
• Can provide false signals on the economic outlook.  
• May provide little more than binary directional guidance (no/yes).• Models are complex and time con-suming to formulate.  
• Requires future forecasts for the exog-enous variables, which increases the estimation error for the model.  
• Model may be mis-specified, and rela-tionships among variables may change over time.

6. A i s correct. Wakuluk started her career when the global markets were expe-
riencing significant volatility and poor returns. She is careful to base her con-
clusions on objective evidence and analytical procedures to mitigate potential biases, which suggests she is seeking to mitigate an availability bias. Availability bias is the tendency to be overly influenced by events that have left a strong im-pression and/or for which it is easy to recall an example.

s correct. Wakuluk’s approach to economic forecasting utilizes both a struc-
tural model (e.g., an econometric model approach) and a diffusion index (e.g., a leading indicator-based approach). However, the two approaches have weak-nesses: An econometric model approach may give a false sense of precision, and a leading indicator-based approach can provide false signals. Two strengths of the checklist approach are its flexibility and limited complexity, although one weakness is that it imposes no consistency of analysis across items or at different points in time.

to be undergoing more rapid structural changes, which may require the analyst to make more significant adjustments relative to past trends.

 A i
s correct. Country X is predicted to be in the initial recovery phase of the busi-
ness cycle, which suggests short-term (money market) rates are low or bottom-ing. Inflation is procyclical. It accelerates in the later stages of the business cycle when the output gap has closed, and it decelerates when a large output gap puts downward pressure on wages and prices, which often happens during a reces-sion or the early years afterward. As long as short-term interest rates adjust with expected inflation, cash is essentially a zero-duration, inflation-protected asset that earns a floating real rate, which is typically procyclical. Wakuluk assumes short-term interest rates adjust with expected inflation and are procyclical. Thus, short-term rates are most likely to be low and bottoming if Country X is in the

initial recovery phase of the business cycle.

 B i
s correct. Wakuluk’s model predicts that Country Z’s business cycle is current-
ly in the late upswing phase. In the late upswing phase, interest rates are typically 
rising as monetary policy becomes more restrictive. Cyclical assets may under-perform, whereas the yield curve is expected to continue to flatten.
11.
 C i
s correct. Monetary policy has been persistently loose for Country Y, while 
fiscal policies have been persistently tight. With this combination of persistently loose and tight policies, the impact could lead to higher or lower nominal rates (typically labeled as mid-nominal rates).
12.
 C i
s correct. Country Y is expected to significantly increase transfer pay-
ments and introduce a more progressive tax regime. Both of these changes are pro-growth government policies and should have a positive impact on the trend rate of growth for a business cycle that is in slowdown or contraction. Transfer payments help mitigate fluctuations in disposable income for the most vulnerable households, while progressive tax regimes imply that the effective tax rate on the private sector is pro-cyclical (i.e., rising as the economy expands and falling as the economy contracts).
13.
 C i
s correct. The current yield curve for Country Y suggests that the business cy-
cle is in the slowdown phase (curve is flat to inverted), with bond yields starting to reflect contractionary conditions (i.e., bond yields are declining). The curve will most likely steepen near term, consistent with the transition to the contrac-tionary phase of the business cycle, and be the steepest on the cusp of the initial recovery phase.

scuss  the implications of Hadpret’s inflation forecast on the expected returns 
of the fund’s holdings of:
Cash The fund benefits from its cyclically low holdings of cash. With the 
economy contracting and inflation falling, short-term rates will likely be in a sharp decline. Cash, or short-term interest-bearing instruments, is unattractive in such an environment. However, deflation may make cash particularly attractive if a “zero lower bound” is binding on the nominal interest rate. Otherwise, deflation is simply a component of the required short-term real rate.
Bonds The fund’s holdings of high-quality bonds will benefit from falling infla-tion or deflation. Falling inflation results in capital gains as the expected inflation component of bond yields falls. Persistent deflation benefits the highest-quality bonds because it increases the purchasing power of their cash flows. It will, however, impair the creditworthiness of lower-quality debt.
Equities The fund’s holdings of asset-intensive and commodity-producing firms will be negatively affected by falling inflation or deflation. Within the equity market, higher inflation benefits firms with the ability to pass along rising costs. In contrast, falling inflation or deflation is especially detrimental for asset-intensive and commodity-producing firms unable to pass along the price increases.
Real Estate The fund’s real estate holdings will be negatively affected by falling infla-
tion or deflation. Falling inflation or deflation will put downward pressure on expected rental income and property values. Especially negatively affected will be sub-prime properties that may have to cut rents sharply to avoid rising vacancies.

15. H adpret expects that, in response to a forecasted contraction in the Eastland 
economy, the central bank will ease monetary policy and the government will 
enact an expansionary fiscal policy. This policy mix has an impact on the shape of the yield curve.
The impact of changes in monetary policy on the yield curve are fairly clear, 
because changes in the yield curve’s slope—its flattening or steepening—are largely determined by the expected movement in short rates. This movement, in turn, is determined by the expected path of monetary policy and the state of the economy. With the central bank easing and the economy contracting, policy rates will be declining and will be expected to decline further as the central bank aims to counteract downward momentum in the economy. Bond yields also decline but by a lesser amount, so the yield curve steepens. The yield curve will typically continue to steepen during the contraction phase as the central bank continues to ease, reaching its steepest point just before the initial recovery phase.
Fiscal policy may affect the shape of the yield curve through the relative supply 
of bonds at various maturities that the government issues to fund deficits. Unlike the impact of monetary policy, the impact of changes in the supply of securities on the yield curve is unclear. The evidence seems to suggest that sufficiently large purchases/sales at different maturities will have only a temporary impact on yields. As a result, the large government budget deficits forecasted by Hadpret are unlikely to have much of a lasting impact on the yield curve, especially given that private sector borrowing will be falling during the contraction, somewhat offsetting the increase in the supply of government securities.

Solutions 67
Scenario 1 Eastland currently has a fixed exchange rate with unrestricted capital flows. 
It is unable to pursue an independent monetary policy, and interest rates will be equal to those in Northland. By restricting capital flows along with a fixed exchange rate, Eastland will be able to run an independent monetary policy with the central bank setting the policy rate. Thus, interest rates can be dif -
ferent in the two countries.
Scenario 2 Eastland currently has a fixed exchange rate pegged to Northland with unre-stricted capital flows. Eastland is unable to pursue an independent mone-tary policy with interest rates in Eastland equal to the interest rates prevail-ing in Northland (the country to which the currency is pegged). If Eastland allows the exchange rate to float, it will now be able to run an independent monetary policy with interest rates determined in its domestic market. The link between interest rates and exchange rates will now be largely expecta-tional and will depend on the expected future path of the exchange rate. To equalize risk-adjusted returns across countries, interest rates must generally be higher (lower) in the country whose currency is expected to depreciate (appreciate). This dynamic often leads to a situation where the currency overshoots in one direction or the other.
Scenario 3 Eastland and Northland (with currencies pegged to each other) will share the 
same yield curve if two conditions are met. First, unrestricted capital mobil-ity must occur between them to ensure that risk-adjusted expected returns will be equalized. Second, the exchange rate between the currencies must be credibly fixed forever. Thus, as long as investors believe that there is no risk in the future of a possible currency appreciation or depreciation, Eastland and Northland will share the same yield curve. A shift in investors’ belief in the credibility of the fixed exchange rate will likely cause risk and yield differentials to emerge. This situation will cause the (default-free) yield curve to differ between Eastland and Northland.

This is the second of two readings focusing on capital market expectations. A central theme of both readings is that a disciplined approach to setting expectations will be rewarded. After outlining a framework for developing expectations and reviewing potential pitfalls, the first reading focused on the use of macroeconomic analysis in setting expectations. This reading builds on that foundation and examines setting expectations for specific asset classes—fixed income, equities, real estate, and cur -

Learning Module 2  C apital Market Expectations, Part 2: Forecasting Asset Class Returns 70
The reading begins with an overview of the techniques frequently used to develop 
capital market expectations. The discussion of specific asset classes begins with fixed 
income in Sections 3 and 4, followed by equities, real estate, and currencies in Sections 
5–7. Estimation of variance–covariance structures is addressed in Section 8. Section 
9 illustrates the use of macroeconomic analysis to develop and justify adjustments to a global portfolio.
OVERVIEW OF TOOLS AND APPROACHES
This section provides a brief overview of the main concepts, approaches, and tools used 
in professional forecasting of capital market returns. Whereas subsequent sections 
focus on specific asset classes, the emphasis here is on the commonality of techniques.
The Nature of the Problem
Few investment practitioners are likely to question the notion that investment oppor -
tunities change in systematic, but imperfectly predictable, ways over time. Yet the ramifications of that fact are often not explicitly recognized. Forecasting returns is not simply a matter of estimating constant, but unknown, parameters—for example, expected returns, variances, and correlations. Time horizons matter. The previous 
reading highlighted two aspects of this issue: the need to ensure intertemporal consis -
tency and the relative usefulness of specific information (e.g., the business cycle) over 
short, intermediate, and long horizons. The choice among forecasting techniques is effectively a choice of the information on which forecasts will be based (in statistical terms, the information on which the forecast is “conditioned”) and how that infor -
mation will be incorporated into the forecasts. The fact that opportunities change over time should, at least in principle, affect strategic investment decisions and how positions respond to changing forecasts.
1
Although investment opportunities are not constant, virtually all forecasting 
techniques rely on notions of central tendency, toward which opportunities tend to revert over time. This fact means that although asset prices, risk premiums, volatil-ities, valuation ratios, and other metrics may exhibit momentum, persistence, and clustering in the short run, over sufficiently long horizons, they tend to converge to levels consistent with economic and financial fundamentals.
What are we trying to forecast? In principle, we are interested in the whole proba -
bility distribution of future returns. In practice, however, forecasting expected return 
is by far the most important consideration, both because it is the dominant driver of most investment decisions and because it is generally more difficult to forecast within practical tolerances than such risk metrics as volatility. Hence, the primary focus here is on expected return. In terms of risk metrics, we limit our attention to variances and covariances.
Approaches to Forecasting
At a very high level, there are essentially three approaches to forecasting: (1) formal tools, (2) surveys, and (3) judgment. Formal tools are established research methods 
amenable to precise definition and independent replication of results. Surveys involve 
1 F or example, in general, it is not optimal to choose a portfolio on the mean–variance-efficient frontier based on forecasts for the coming period. In addition, the distinction between “strategic” and “tactical” 
asset allocation is less clear cut since, in general, the optimal allocation evolves with the investor’s remaining 
investment horizon. See Piros (2015) for a non-technical exposition of these issues.2

Overview of Tools and Approaches 71
asking a group of experts for their opinions. Judgment can be described as a qualita-
tive synthesis of information derived from various sources and filtered through the lens of experience.
Surveys are probably most useful as a way to gauge consensus views, which can 
serve as inputs into formal tools and the analyst’s own judgment. Judgment is always important. There is ample scope for applying judgment—in particular, economic and psychological insight—to improve forecasts and numbers, including those produced 
by elaborate quantitative models. In using survey results and applying their own 
judgment, analysts must be wary of the psychological traps discussed in the Capital Market Expectations Part 1 reading. Beyond these brief observations, however, there is not much new to be said about surveys and judgment.
The formal forecasting tools most commonly used in forecasting capital market 
returns fall into three broad categories: statistical methods, discounted cash flow 
models, and risk premium models. The distinctions among these methods will become 
clear as they are discussed and applied throughout the reading.
Statistical Methods
All the formal tools involve data and statistical analysis to some degree. Methods that 
are primarily, if not exclusively, statistical impose relatively little structure on the data. 
As a result, the forecasts inherit the statistical properties of the data with limited, if 
any, regard for economic or financial reasoning. Three types of statistical methods will 
be covered in this reading. The first approach is to use well-known sample statistics, 
such as sample means, variances, and correlations, to describe the distribution of future returns. This is undoubtedly the clearest example of simply taking the data at face value. Unfortunately, sampling error makes some of these statistics—in particu-lar, the sample mean—very imprecise. The second approach, shrinkage estimation, 
involves taking a weighted average of two estimates of the same parameter—one based 
on historical sample data and the other based on some other source or information, 
such as the analyst’s “prior” knowledge. This “two-estimates-are-better-than-one” 
approach has the desirable property of reducing forecast errors relative to simple sample statistics. The third method, time-series estimation, involves forecasting a variable on the basis of lagged values of the variable being forecast and often lagged 
values of other selected variables. These models have the benefit of explicitly incorpo -
rating dynamics into the forecasting process. However, since they are reduced-form models, they may summarize the historical data well without providing much insight into the underlying drivers of the forecasts.
Discounted Cash Flow
Discounted cash flow (DCF) models express the idea that an asset’s value is the 
present value of its expected cash flows. They are a basic method for establishing the 
intrinsic value of an asset on the basis of fundamentals and its fair required rate of return. Conversely, they are used to estimate the required rate of return implied by the asset’s current price.
Risk Premium Models
The risk premium approach expresses the expected return on a risky asset as the 
sum of the risk-free rate of interest and one or more risk premiums that compensate investors for the asset’s exposure to sources of priced risk (risk for which investors demand compensation). There are three main methods for modeling risk premiums: (1) an equilibrium model, such as the CAPM, (2) a factor model, and (3) building blocks. Each of these methods was discussed in earlier readings. Equilibrium models and factor models both impose a structure on how returns are assumed to be gener -
ated. Hence, they can be used to generate estimates of (1) expected returns and (2) variances and covariances.

FORECASTING FIXED INCOME RETURNS
discuss approaches to setting expectations for fixed-income returns
There are three main ways to approach forecasting fixed-income returns. The first is 
discounted cash flow. This method is really the only one that is precise enough to use 
in support of trades involving individual fixed-income securities. This type of “micro” 
analysis will not be discussed in detail here since it is covered extensively elsewhere in CFA Program curriculum readings that focus on fixed income. DCF concepts are also useful in forecasting the more aggregated performance needed to support asset allocation decisions. The second approach is the risk premium approach, which is often applied to fixed income, in part because fixed-income premiums are among the building blocks used to estimate expected returns on riskier asset classes, such as 
equities. The third approach is to include fixed-income asset classes in an equilibrium 
model. Doing so has the advantage of imposing consistency across asset classes and is especially useful as a first step in applying the Black–Litterman framework, which will be discussed in a later reading.
Applying DCF to Fixed Income
Fixed income is really all about discounted cash flow. This stems from the facts that almost all fixed-income securities have finite maturities and that the (promised) cash flows are known, governed by explicit rules, or can be modeled with a reasonably 
high degree of accuracy (e.g., mortgage-backed security prepayments). Using modern 
arbitrage-free models, we can value virtually any fixed-income instrument. The most 
straightforward and, undoubtedly, most precise way to forecast fixed-income returns 
is to explicitly value the securities on the basis of the assumed evolution of the critical 
inputs to the valuation model—for example, the spot yield curve, the term structure of 
volatilities, and prepayment speeds. A whole distribution of returns can be generated 
by doing this for a variety of scenarios. As noted previously, this is essentially the only option if we need the “micro” precision of accounting for rolling down the yield curve, changes in the shape of the yield curve, changes in rate volatilities, or changes 
in the sensitivity of contingent cash flows. But for many purposes—for example, asset 
allocation—we usually do not need such granularity.
Yield to maturity (YTM)—the single discount rate that equates the present value 
of a bond’s cash flows to its market price—is by far the most commonly quoted metric 
of valuation and, implicitly, of expected return for bonds. For bond portfolios, the 
YTM is usually calculated as if it were simply an average of the individual bonds’ YTM, 
which is not exactly accurate but is a reasonable approximation.2 Forecasting bond 
returns would be very easy if we could simply equate yield to maturity with expected return. It is not that simple, but YTM does provide a reasonable and readily available first approximation.
Assuming cash flows are received in full and on time, there are two main reasons 
why realized return may not equal the initial yield to maturity. First, if the investment 
horizon is shorter than the amount of time until the bond’s maturity, any change in interest rate (i.e., the bond’s YTM) will generate a capital gain or loss at the horizon. Second, the cash flows may be reinvested at rates above or below the initial YTM. 
2 B ear in mind that yield to maturity does not account for optionality. However, various yield measures 
derived from option-adjusted valuation can be viewed as conveying similar information. To keep the present 
discussion as simple as possible, we ignore the distinction here. If optionality is critical to the forecast, it may be necessary to apply the more granular DCF framework discussed previously.3

Forecasting Fixed Income Returns 73
The longer the horizon, the more sensitive the realized return will be to reinvestment 
rates. These two issues work in opposite directions: Rising (falling) rates induce 
capital losses (gains) but increase (decrease) reinvestment income. If the investment 
horizon equals the (Macaulay) duration of the bond or portfolio, the capital gain/loss and reinvestment effects will roughly offset, leaving the realized return close to the 
original YTM. This relationship is exact if (a) the yield curve is flat and (b) the change 
in rates occurs immediately in a single step. In practice, the relationship is only an approximation. Nonetheless, it provides an important insight: Over horizons shorter than the duration, the capital gain/loss impact will tend to dominate such that rising (declining) rates imply lower (higher) return, whereas over horizons longer than the duration, the reinvestment impact will tend to dominate such that rising (declining) rates imply higher (lower) return.
Note that the timing of rate changes matters. It will not have much effect, if any, 
on the capital gain/loss component because that ultimately depends on the beginning 
and ending values of the bond or portfolio. But it does affect the reinvestment return. 
The longer the horizon, the more it matters. Hence, for long-term forecasts, we should 
break the forecast horizon into subperiods corresponding to when we expect the largest rate changes to occur.
EXAMPLE 1
Forecasting Return Based on Yield to Maturity
1. J esper Bloch works for Discrete Asset Management (DAM) in Zurich. Many 
of the firm’s more risk-averse clients invest in a currency-hedged global government bond strategy that uses cash flows to purchase new issues and seasoned bonds all along the yield curve to maintain a roughly constant maturity and duration profile. The yield to maturity of the portfolio is 1% (compounded annually), and the modified duration is 4.84. DAM’s chief investment officer believes global government yields are likely to rise by 200 bps over the next two years as central banks remove extraordinarily ac-commodative policies and inflation surges. Bloch has been asked to project approximate returns for this strategy over horizons of two, five, and seven years. What conclusions is Bloch likely to draw?
Solution:
If yields were not expected to change, the return would be very close to the yield to maturity (1%) over each horizon. The Macaulay duration is 4.89 (= 4.84 × 1.01), so if the yield change occurred immediately, the capital gain/loss and reinvestment impacts on return would roughly balance over five years. Ignoring convexity (which is not given), the capital loss at the end of two years will be approximately 9.68% (= 4.84 × 2%). Assuming yields rise linearly over the initial two-year period, the higher reinvestment rates will boost the cumulative return by approximately 1.0% over two years, so the annual return over two years will be approximately −3.3% [= 1 + (−9.68 + 1.0)/2]. Reinvesting for three more years at the 2.0% higher rate adds anoth-er 6.0% to the cumulative return, so the five-year annual return would be ap-proximately 0.46% [= 3.25 + (1 + 1.0 + 6.0)/5]. With an additional two years of reinvestment income, the seven-year annual return would be about 1.99% [= 1 + (−9.68 + 1.0 + 6.0 + 4.0)/7]. As expected, the capital loss dominated the return over two years, and higher reinvestment rates dominated over seven years. The gradual nature of the yield increase extended the horizon

over which the capital gain/loss and reinvestment effects would balance 
beyond the initial five-year Macaulay duration.
We have extended the DCF approach beyond simply finding the discount rates 
implied by current market prices (e.g., YTMs), which might be considered the “pure” DCF approach. For other asset classes (e.g., equities), the connection between dis -
count rates and valuations/returns is vague because there is so much uncertainty with 
respect to the cash flows. For these asset classes, discounted cash flow is essentially a conceptual framework rather than a precise valuation model. In contrast, in fixed income there is a tight connection between discount rates, valuations, and returns. 
We are, therefore, able to refine the “pure” DCF forecast by incorporating projections 
of how rates will evolve over the investment horizon. Doing so is particularly useful in formulating short-term forecasts.
The Building Block Approach to Fixed-Income Returns
The building block approach forms an estimate of expected return in terms of required 
compensation for specific types of risk. The required return for fixed-income asset 
classes has four components: the one-period default-free rate, the term premium, the 
credit premium, and the liquidity premium. As the names indicate, the premiums reflect compensation for interest rate risk, duration risk, credit risk, and illiquidity, respectively. Only one of the four components—the short-term default-free rate—is (potentially) observable. For example, the term premium and the credit premium are implicitly embedded in yield spreads, but they are not equal  to observed yield 
spreads. Next, we will consider each of these components and summarize applicable empirical regularities.
The Short-term Default-free Rate
In principle, the short-term default-free rate is the rate on the highest-quality, most 
liquid instrument with a maturity that matches the forecast horizon. In practice, 
it is usually taken to be a government zero-coupon bill at a maturity that is issued 
frequently—say, every three months. This rate is virtually always tied closely to the central bank’s policy rate and, therefore, mirrors the cyclical dynamics of monetary policy. Secular movements are closely tied to expected inflation levels.
Under normal circumstances, the observed rate is a reasonable base on which to 
build expected returns for risky assets. In extreme circumstances, however, it may be necessary to adopt a normalized rate. For example, when policy rates or short-term 
government rates are negative, using the observed rate without adjustment may unduly 
reduce the required/expected return estimate for risky instruments. An alternative to 
normalizing the short rate in this circumstance would be to raise the estimate of one or more of the risk premiums on the basis of the notion that the observed negative short rate reflects an elevated willingness to pay for safety or, conversely, elevated required compensation for risk.
Forecast horizons substantially longer than the maturity of the standard short-term 
instrument call for a different type of adjustment. There are essentially two approaches. 
The first is to use the yield on a longer zero-coupon bond with a maturity that matches 
the horizon. In theory, that is the right thing to do. It does, however, call into question 
the role of the term premium since the longer-term rate will already incorporate the 
term premium. The second approach is to replace today’s observed short-term rate with 
an estimate of the return that would be generated by rolling the short-term instrument 
over the forecast horizon; that is, take account of the likely path of short-term rates. 
This approach does not change the interpretation of the term premium. In addition to 
helping establish the baseline return to which risk premiums will be added, explicitly projecting the path of short-term rates may help in estimating the term premium.

Forecasting Fixed Income Returns 75
In many markets, there are futures contracts for short-term instruments. The rates 
implied by these contracts are frequently interpreted as the market’s expected path 
of short-term rates. As such, they provide an excellent starting point for analysts in formulating their own projections. Some central banks—for example, the US Federal Reserve Board—publish projections of future policy rates that can also serve as a 
guide for analysts. Quantitative models, such as the Taylor rule, provide another tool.3
The Term Premium
The default-free spot rate curve reflects the expected path of short-term rates and 
the required term premiums for each maturity. It is tempting to think that given a projected path of short-term rates, we can easily deduce the term premiums from the spot curve. We can, of course, derive a set of forward rates in the usual way and 
subtract the projected short-term rate for each future period. Doing so would give an 
implied sequence of period-by-period premiums. This may be a useful exercise, but it will not give us what we really want—the expected returns for bonds of different maturities over our forecast horizon. The implication is that although the yield curve 
contains the information we want and may be useful in forecasting returns, we cannot 
derive the term premium directly from the curve itself.
A vast amount of academic research has been devoted over many decades to 
addressing three fundamental questions: Do term premiums exist? If so, are they constant? And if they exist, how are they related to maturity? The evidence indicates 
that term premiums are positive and increase with maturity, are roughly proportional 
to duration, and vary over time. The first of these properties implies that term pre-miums are important. The second allows the analyst to be pragmatic, focusing on a single term premium, which is then scaled by duration. The third property implies that basing estimates on current information is essential.
Ilmanen (2012) argued that there are four main drivers of the term premium for 
nominal bonds.
 ■Level-dependent inflation uncertainty: Inflation is arguably the main driver of long-run variation in both nominal yields and the term premium. Higher (lower) levels of inflation tend to coincide with greater (less) inflation uncer -
tainty. Hence, nominal yields rise (fall) with inflation because of changes in both expected inflation and the inflation risk component of the term premium.
 ■Ability to hedge recession risk: In theory, assets earn a low (or negative) risk premium if they tend to perform well when the economy is weak. When growth and inflation are primarily driven by aggregate demand, nominal bond returns tend to be negatively correlated with growth and a relatively low term premium is warranted. Conversely, when growth and inflation are primarily driven by aggregate supply, nominal bond returns tend to be posi-tively correlated with growth, necessitating a higher term premium.
 ■Supply and demand: The relative outstanding supply of short-maturity and long-maturity default-free bonds influences the slope of the yield curve.

This phenomenon is largely attributable to the term premium since the maturity structure of outstanding debt should have little impact on the expected future path of short-term rates.

 ■Cyclical effects: The slope of the yield curve varies substantially over the 
business cycle: It is steep around the trough of the cycle and flat or even inverted around the peak. Much of this movement reflects changes in the expected path of short-term rates. However, it also reflects countercyclical changes in the term premium.
Although the slope of the yield curve is useful information on which to base fore-
casts of the term premium, other indicators work as well or better. Exhibit 1 shows 
correlations with subsequent excess bond returns (7- to 10-year Treasury bond return 
minus 3-month Treasury bill return) over 1-quarter, 1-year, and 5-year horizons for eight indicators. The indicators are listed in descending order of the (absolute value of the) correlation with one-year returns. The first four are derived from the bond market. The ex ante real yield has the strongest relationship over each horizon. Next on the list are the two most complex indicators. The Cochrane and Piazzesi curve factor is a composite measure capturing both the slope and the curvature of the yield curve.
6 The Kim and Wright premium is derived from a three-factor term structure 
model.7 The slope of the yield curve is next on the list. Note that it has the weakest 
relationship over the five-year horizon. The supply indicator—the share of debt with 
maturity greater than 10 years—has a particularly strong relationship over the longest 
horizon. Since this variable tends to change gradually over time, it is not surprising that it is more closely related to long-run average returns than it is to shorter-term returns. The three cyclical proxies—the corporate profit-to-GDP ratio, business con-fidence, and the unemployment rate—are at the bottom of the list since they had the weakest correlation with return over the next year.

The Credit Premium
The credit premium is the additional expected return demanded for bearing the risk 
of default losses—importantly, in addition to compensation for the expected level of losses. Both expected default losses and the credit premium are embedded in credit 
spreads. They cannot be recovered from those spreads unless we impose some structure 
liabilities. As an example, the long end of the UK curve was severely squeezed in the 1990s.6

(i.e., a model) on default-free rates, default probabilities, and recovery rates. The two 
main types of models—structural credit models and reduced-form credit models—are 
described in detail in other readings.8 In the following discussion, we will focus on 
the empirical behavior of the credit premium.
An analysis of 150 years of defaults among US non-financial corporate bonds 
showed that the severity of default losses accounted for only about half of the 1.53% 
average yield spread.9 Hence, holders of corporate bonds did, on average, earn a credit 
premium to bear the risk of default. However, the pattern of actual defaults suggests 
the premium was earned very unevenly over time. In particular, high and low default 
rates tended to persist, causing clusters of high and low annual default rates and resul -
tant losses. The study found that the previous year’s default rate, stock market return, 
stock market volatility, and GDP growth rate were predictive of the subsequent year’s 
default rate. However, the aggregate credit spread was not predictive of subsequent 
defaults. Contemporaneous financial market variables—stock returns, stock volatility, 
and the riskless rate—were significant in explaining the credit spread, but neither GDP growth nor changes in the default rate helped explain the credit spread. This finding suggests that credit spreads were driven primarily by the credit risk premium and financial market conditions and only secondarily by fundamental changes in the expected level of default losses. Thus, credit spreads do contain information relevant to predicting the credit premium.
Ilmanen (2012) hypothesized that credit spreads and the credit premiums embedded 
in them are driven by different factors, depending on credit quality. Default rates on 
top-quality (AAA and AA) bonds are extremely low, so very little of the spread/premium 
is due to the likelihood of actual default in the absence of a change in credit quality. Instead, the main driver is “downgrade bias”—the fact that a deterioration in credit quality (resulting in a rating downgrade) is much more likely than an improvement in credit quality (leading to an upgrade) and that downgrades induce larger spread 
changes than upgrades do.10 Bonds rated A and BBB have moderate default rates. They 
still do not have a high likelihood of actual default losses, but their prospects are more 
sensitive to cyclical forces and their spreads/premiums vary more (countercyclically) 
over the cycle. Default losses are of utmost concern for below-investment-grade bonds. 
Defaults tend to cluster in times when the economy is in recession. In addition, the default rate and the severity of losses in default tend to rise and fall together. These characteristics imply big losses at the worst times, necessitating substantial compen-sation for this risk. Not too surprisingly, high-yield spreads/premiums tend to rise ahead of realized default rates.
Exhibit 2 shows three variables that have tended to predict excess returns (over 
T-bills) for an index of US investment-grade corporate bonds over the next quarter 
and the next year. Not surprisingly, a high corporate option-adjusted spread is bullish 
for corporate bond performance because it indicates a large cushion against credit 
losses—that is, a higher credit premium. A steep Treasury curve is also bullish because, 
as mentioned earlier, it tends to correspond to the trough of the business cycle when 
default rates begin to decline. Combining these insights with those from Exhibit 1, the 
implication is that a steep yield curve predicts both a high term premium and a high

 S
ee Giesecke, Longstaff, Schaefer, and Strebulaev (2011). Default rates were measured as a fraction of 
the par value of outstanding bonds. The authors did not document actual recovery rates, instead assuming 50% recovery. Hence, the true level of losses could have been somewhat higher or lower.
10 L iquidity relative to government bonds is also an important contributor to yield spreads on very 
high-quality private sector bonds. By definition, of course, this is really the liquidity premium, rather than part of the credit premium.

credit premium. Higher implied volatility in the equity market was also bullish for 
corporates, most likely reflecting risk-averse pricing—that is, high risk premiums—across all markets.

How are credit premiums related to maturity? Aside from situations of imminent default, there is greater risk of default losses the longer one must wait for payment. 
We might, therefore, expect that longer-maturity corporate bonds would offer higher 
credit risk premiums. The historical evidence suggests that this has not been the 
case. Credit premiums tend to be especially generous at the short end of the curve. This may be due to “event risk, ” in the sense that a default, no matter how unlikely, could still cause a huge proportional loss but there is no way that the bond will pay more than the issuer promised. It may also be due, in part, to illiquidity since many 
short-maturity bonds are old issues that rarely trade as they gradually approach matu -
rity. As a result, many portfolio managers use a strategy known as a “credit barbell” in which they concentrate credit exposure at short maturities and take interest rate/duration risk via long-maturity government bonds.
The Liquidity Premium
Relatively few bond issues trade actively for more than a few weeks after issuance. 
Secondary market trading occurs primarily in the most recently issued sovereign bonds, 
current coupon mortgage-backed securities, and a few of the largest high-quality 
corporate bonds. The liquidity of other bonds largely depends on the willingness of 
dealers to hold them in inventory long enough to find a buyer. In general, liquidity tends to be better for bonds that are (a) priced near par/reflective of current market 
levels, (b) relatively new, (c) from a relatively large issue, (d) from a well-known/
frequent issuer, (e) standard/simple in structure, and (f) high quality. These factors tend to reduce the dealer’s risk in holding the bond and increase the likelihood of finding a buyer quickly.
As a baseline estimate of the “pure” liquidity premium in a particular market, the 
analyst can look to the yield spread between fixed-rate, option-free bonds from the 
highest-quality issuer (virtually always the sovereign) and the next highest-quality large 
issuer of similar bonds (often a government agency or quasi-agency). Adjustments should then be made for the factors listed previously. In general, the impact of each factor is likely to increase disproportionately as one moves away from baseline attri-butes. For example, each step lower in credit quality is likely to have a bigger impact on liquidity than that of the preceding step.

Fixed-Income Building Blocks
Salimah Rahman works for SMECo, a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund. 
Each year, the fund’s staff updates its projected returns for the following year on 
the basis of developments in the preceding year. The fund uses the building block 
approach in making its fixed-income projections. Rahman has been assigned 
the task of revising the key building block components for a major European bond market. The following table shows last year’s values:
 
  Description Value
Risk-free rate 3-month government bill 1.00%
Term premium 5-year duration 0.50%
Credit premium Baa/BBB corporate 0.90%
Liquidity premium Government-guaranteed agency 0.15%
 
Although inflation rose modestly, the central bank cut its policy rate by 
50 bps in response to weakening growth. Aggregate corporate profits have 
remained solid, and after a modest correction, the stock market finished higher for the year. However, defaults on leveraged loans were unexpectedly high this year, and confidence surveys weakened again recently. Equity option volatility spiked mid-year but ended the year somewhat lower. The interest rate futures curve has flattened but remains upward sloping. The 10-year government yield declined only a few basis points, while the yield on comparable government agency bonds remained unchanged and corporate spreads—both nominal and option adjusted—widened.

 Indic
ate the developments that are likely to cause Rahman to increase/de-
crease each of the key building blocks relative to last year.
Guideline answer:
Based on the reduction in policy rates and the flattening of the interest rate 
futures curve, Rahman is virtually certain to reduce the short-term rate component. Steepening of the yield curve (10-year yield barely responded to the 50 bp rate cut) indicates an increase in both the term premium and the credit premium. Declining confidence also suggests a higher term premium. Widening of credit spreads is also indicative of a higher credit premium. However, the increase in loan defaults suggests that credit losses are likely to be higher next year as well, since defaults tend to cluster. All else the same, this reduces the expected return on corporate bonds/loans. Hence, the credit premium should increase less than would otherwise be implied by the steeper yield curve and wider credit spreads. Modest widening of the government agency spread indicates an increase in the liquidity pre-mium. The resilience of the equity market and the decline in equity option volatility suggest that investors are not demanding a general increase in risk premiums.

RISKS IN EMERGING MARKET BONDS
discuss risks faced by investors in emerging market fixed-income 
securities and the country risk analysis techniques used to evaluate emerging market economies
Emerging market debt was once nearly synonymous with crisis. The Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s involved bank loans but essentially triggered development 
of a market for emerging market bonds. In the early 1990s, the Mexican crisis 
occurred. In the late 1990s, there was the Asian crisis, followed by the Russian crisis, which contributed to the turmoil that sank the giant hedge fund Long-Term Capital 
Management. There have been other, more isolated, events, such as Argentina’s forced 
restructuring of its debt, but the emerging market bond market has grown, deepened, 
and matured. What started with only a few government issuers borrowing in hard 
currencies (from their perspective foreign, but widely used, currencies) has grown into 
a market in which corporations as well as governments issue in their local currencies and in hard currencies. The discussion here applies not just to emerging markets but also to what are known as “frontier” markets (when they are treated separately or as a subset of emerging markets).
Investing in emerging market debt involves all the same risks as investing in 
developed country debt, such as interest rate movements, currency movements, and potential defaults. In addition, it poses risks that are, although not entirely absent, less significant in developed markets. These risks fall roughly into two categories: (1) economic and (2) political and legal. A slightly different breakdown would be “ability to pay” and “willingness to pay. ”
Before discussing these country risks, note that some countries that are labeled as 
emerging markets may in fact be healthy, prosperous economies with strong funda-mentals. Likewise, the political and legal issues discussed in this section may or may not apply to any particular country. Furthermore, these risks will, in general, apply in varying degrees across countries. Emerging markets are widely recognized as a very heterogeneous group. It is up to the analyst to assess which considerations are relevant to a particular investment decision.
Economic Risks/Ability to Pay
Emerging market economies as a whole have characteristics that make them potentially 
more vulnerable to distress and hence less likely to be able to pay their debts on time or in full, such as the following:
 ■Greater concentration of wealth and income; less diverse tax base
 ■Greater dependence on specific industries, especially cyclical industries, such as commodities and agriculture; low potential for pricing power in world markets
 ■Restrictions on trade, capital flows, and currency conversion
 ■Poor fiscal controls and monetary discipline
 ■Less educated and less skilled work force; poor or limited physical infra-structure; lower level of industrialization and technological sophistication
 ■Reliance on foreign borrowing, often in hard currencies not their own
 ■Small/less sophisticated financial markets and institutions4

Risks in Emerging Market Bonds 81
 ■Susceptibility to capital flight; perceived vulnerability contributing to actual 
vulnerability
Although history is at best an imperfect guide to the future, the analyst should 
examine a country’s track record on critical issues. Have there been crises in the past? 
If so, how were they handled/resolved? Has the sovereign defaulted? Is there restruc -
tured debt? How have authorities responded to fiscal challenges? Is there inflation or currency instability?
The analyst should, of course, examine the health of the macroeconomy in some 
detail. A few indicative guidelines can be helpful. If there is one ratio that is most closely watched, it is the ratio of the fiscal deficit to GDP . Most emerging countries have deficits and perpetually struggle to reduce them. A persistent ratio above 4% is likely a cause for concern. A debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 70%–80%, perhaps of only mild concern for a developed market, is a sign of vulnerability for an emerging market. A persistent annual real growth rate less than 4% suggests that an emerging market is catching up with more advanced economies only slowly, if at all, and per capita income might even be falling—a potential source of political stress. Persistent current account deficits greater than 4% of GDP probably indicate lack of compet -
itiveness. Foreign debt greater than 50% of GDP or greater than 200% of current 
account receipts is also a sign of danger. Finally, foreign exchange reserves less than 100% of short-term debt is risky, whereas a ratio greater than 200% is ample. It must be emphasized that the numbers given here are merely suggestive of levels that may indicate a need for further scrutiny.
When all else fails, a country may need to call on external support mechanisms. 
Hence, the analyst should consider whether the country has access to support from the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, or other international agencies.
Political and Legal Risks/Willingness to Pay
Investors in emerging market debt may be unable to enforce their claims or recover their investments. Weak property rights laws and weak enforcement of contract laws are clearly of concern in this regard. Inability to enforce seniority structures within private sector claims is one important example. The principle of sovereign immunity makes it very difficult to force a sovereign borrower to pay its debts. Confiscation of property, nationalization of companies, and corruption are also relevant hazards. Coalition governments may also pose political instability problems. Meanwhile, the imposition of capital controls or restrictions on currency conversion may make it difficult, or even impossible, to repatriate capital.
As with economic risks, history may provide some guidance with respect to the 
severity of political and legal risks. The following are some pertinent questions: Is 
there a history of nationalization, expropriation, or other violations of property rights? 
How have international disputes been resolved and under which legal jurisdiction? Has the integrity of the judicial system and process been questioned? Are political 
institutions stable? Are they recognized as legitimate and subject to reasonable checks 
and balances? Has the transfer of power been peaceful, orderly, and lawful? Does the 
political process give rise to fragile coalitions that collapse whenever events strain the 
initial compromises with respect to policy?

Emerging Market Bonds
1. B elvia has big aspirations. Although still a poor country, it has been growing 
rapidly, averaging 6% real and 10% nominal growth for the last five years. At 
the beginning of this period of growth, a centrist coalition gained a narrow majority over the authoritarian, fiscally irresponsible, anti-investor, an-ti-business party that had been in power for decades. The government has removed the old barriers to trade, including the signing of a regional free-trade agreement, and removed capital controls. Much of its growth has been fueled by investment in its dominant industry—natural resources—financed by debt and foreign direct investment flows. These policies have been popu-lar with the business community, as has the relaxation of regulations affect-ing key constituencies. Meanwhile, to ensure that prosperity flows rapidly to the people, the government has allowed redistributive social payments to grow even faster than GDP , resulting in a large and rising fiscal deficit (5% of GDP this year, projected to be 7% in two years). The current account deficit is 8% of GDP . Despite the large current account deficit, the local currency has appreciated significantly since it was allowed to float two years ago. The government has just announced that it will issue a large 10-year local cur-rency bond under Belvian law—the first issue of its kind in many years.
Despite a very strong relationship with the bank marketing the bond, Peter 
Valt has decided not to invest in it. When pressed for his reasoning, what risks is he likely to identify?
Solution:
There are several significant risks and warning signs. Coalition govern-ments are often unstable, and the most likely alternative would appear to be a return to the previously dominant party that lacks fiscal discipline. That regime is likely to undo the recent pro-growth policies and might even disavow the debt, including this new bond. The bond will be governed by Belvian law, which, combined with the principle of sovereign immunity, will make it very difficult for foreigners to enforce their claims. In addition, the relaxation of regulations affecting key constituencies hints strongly at corruption and possibly at payoffs within the current regime. With respect to the economy, fiscal discipline remains poor, there is heavy reliance on a single industry, and the current account deficit is almost certainly unsus-tainable (e.g., over the 10-year life of this bond). In addition, the currency is very likely to be overvalued, which will both make it very difficult to broaden global competitiveness beyond natural resources and increase the investor’s risk of substantial currency losses.

FORECASTING EQUITY RETURNS
discuss approaches to setting expectations for equity investment 
market returns
discuss risks faced by investors in emerging market equity securities
The task of forecasting equity market returns is often the central focus of setting capital market expectations. In this section, we discuss applying each of the major methodologies to equities.
Historical Statistics Approach to Equity Returns
Exhibit 3 shows the mean real return for each market portfolio centered within a 95% confidence interval. Results are also shown for a world portfolio, a world ex-US portfolio, and Europe. The portfolios are ordered from left to right on the basis of the mean return.
The means range from a low of 5.0% for Austria to a high of 9.4% in South Africa. 
Note that both of these values lie within the confidence interval for every country. From a statistical perspective, there is really no difference among these markets in terms of mean real return. This illustrates the fact that sample averages, even derived from seemingly long histories, are very imprecise estimates unless the volatility of the data is small relative to the mean. Clearly that is not the case for equity returns. 
Nonetheless, sample means are frequently cited without regard to the quality of 
information they convey.

As indicated in Section 2, shrinkage estimators can often provide more reliable esti-
mates by combining the sample mean with a second estimate of the mean return. However, the application of a common shrinkage estimator confirms that there is no basis for believing that the true expected returns for the countries in Exhibit 3 are different.
DCF Approach to Equity Returns
Analysts have frequently used the Gordon (constant) growth model form of the 
dividend discount model, solved for the required rate of return, to formulate the 
long-term expected return of equity markets. Although this model is quite simple, it has a big advantage over using historical stock returns to project future returns. The vast majority of the “noise” in historical stock returns comes from fluctuations in the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and the ratio of earnings to GDP . Since the amount of earnings appears in the numerator of one ratio and the denominator of the other, the impact of these ratios tends to cancel out over time, leaving the relationship between equity market appreciation and GDP growth much more stable. And GDP growth 
itself, especially the real growth component, is much less volatile and hence relatively 
predictable.11 As an illustration, Exhibit 4 shows historical volatilities (defined as the 
standard deviation of percentage changes) for the S&P 500 Index return, P/E, the 
earnings-to-GDP ratio, real US GDP growth, and inflation for 1946–2016. The Gordon 
growth model allows us to take advantage of this relative stability by linking long-term 
equity appreciation to a more stable foundation—economic growth.

Note: Standard deviation of % changes
In the United States and other major markets, share repurchases have become an important way for companies to distribute cash to shareholders. Grinold and Kroner 
(2002) provided a restatement of the Gordon growth model that takes explicit 
account of repurchases. Their model also provides a means for analysts to incorpo-rate expectations of valuation levels through the familiar price-to-earnings ratio. The Grinold–Kroner model
12 is
  E   (   R  e   )     ≈   D _ P   +    (  %ΔE − %ΔS )     + %ΔP / E ,  (1)
where E(Re) is the expected equity return, D /P is the dividend yield, %ΔE  is the expected 
percentage change in total earnings, %ΔS  is the expected percentage change in shares 
outstanding, and %ΔP/E is the expected percentage change in the price-to-earnings 
ratio. The term in parentheses, (%ΔE  − %ΔS ), is the growth rate of earnings per share. 
Net share repurchases (%ΔS  < 0) imply that earnings per share grows faster than total 
earnings.
With a minor rearrangement of the equation, the expected return can be divided 
into three components:
 ■Expected cash flow (“income”) return: D /P − %ΔS

 ■Expected nominal earnings growth return: %ΔE
 ■Expected repricing return: %ΔP/E
The expected nominal earnings growth return and the expected repricing return 
constitute the expected capital gains.
In principle, the Grinold–Kroner model assumes an infinite horizon. In practice, 
the analyst typically needs to make projections for finite horizons, perhaps several 
horizons. In applying the model, the analyst needs to be aware of the implications of constant growth rate assumptions over different horizons. Failure to tailor growth 
rates to the horizon can easily lead to implausible results. As an example, suppose the 
P/E is currently 16.0 and the analyst believes that it will revert to a level of 20 and be stable thereafter. The P/E growth rates for various horizons that are consistent with this view are 4.56% for 5 years, 2.26% for 10 years, 0.75% for 30 years, and an arbi-trarily small positive number for a truly long-term horizon. Treating, say, the 2.26% 10-year number as if it is appropriate for the “long run” would imply an ever-rising 
P/E rather than convergence to a plausible long-run valuation. The only very long-run 
assumptions that are consistent with economically plausible relationships are %ΔE  = 
Nominal GDP growth, %ΔS = 0, and %ΔP/E = 0. The longer the (finite) horizon, the less the analyst’s projection should deviate from these values.
EXAMPLE 4
Forecasting the Equity Return Using the Grinold–Kroner 
Model
Cynthia Casey uses the Grinold–Kroner model in forecasting developed market 
equity returns. Casey makes the following forecasts:
 ■a 2.25% dividend yield on Canadian equities, based on the S&P/TSE 
Composite Index;
 ■a 1% rate of net share repurchases for Canadian equities;
 ■a long-term corporate earnings growth rate of 6% per year, based on a 1 percentage point (pp) premium for corporate earnings growth over her expected Canadian (nominal) GDP growth rate of 5%; and
 ■an expansion rate for P/E multiples of 0.25% per year.

 B
ased on the information given, what expected rate of return on Canadian 
equities is implied by Casey’s assumptions?
Solution:
The expected rate of return on Canadian equities based on Casey’s assump-tions would be 9.5%, calculated as
 E(
Re) ≈ 2.25% + [6.0% − (−1.0%)] + 0.25% = 9.5%.
2.
 Ar
e Casey’s assumptions plausible for the long run and for a 10-year 
horizon?
Solution:
Casey’s assumptions are not plausible for the very long run. The assumption that earnings will grow 1% faster than GDP implies one of two things: either an ever-rising ratio of economy-wide earnings to GDP or the earnings ac-cruing to businesses not included in the index (e.g., private firms) continual-

ly shrinking relative to GDP . Neither is likely to persist indefinitely. Similarly, 
perpetual share repurchases would eventually eliminate all shares, whereas a perpetually rising P/E would lead to an arbitrarily high price per Canadian dollar of earnings per share. Based on Casey’s economic growth forecast, a more reasonable long-run expected return would be 7.25% = 2.25% + 5.0%.
Casey’s assumptions are plausible for a 10-year horizon. Over 10 years, the 
ratio of earnings to GDP would rise by roughly 10.5% = (1.01)
10 − 1, shares 
outstanding would shrink by roughly 9.6% = 1 − (0.99)10, and the P/E would 
rise by about 2.5% = (1.0025)10 − 1.
Most of the inputs to the Grinold–Kroner model are fairly readily available. 
Economic growth forecasts can easily be found in investment research publications, reports from such agencies as the IMF, the World Bank, and the OECD, and likely from the analyst firm’s own economists. Data on the rate of share repurchases are less straightforward but are likely to be tracked by sell-side firms and occasionally mentioned in research publications. The big question is how to gauge valuation of the market in order to project changes in the P/E.
The fundamental valuation metrics used in practice typically take the form of a ratio 
of price to some fundamental flow variable—such as earnings, cash flow, or sales—with seemingly endless variations in how the measures are defined and calculated. Whatever the metric, the implicit assumption is that it has a well-defined long-run mean value to which it will revert. In statistical terms, it is a stationary random vari-able. Extensive empirical evidence indicates that these valuation measures are poor predictors of short-term performance. Over multi-year horizons, however, there is a reasonably strong tendency for extreme values to be corrected. Thus, these metrics do provide guidance for projecting intermediate-term movements in valuation.
Gauging what is or is not an extreme value is complicated by the fact that all the 
fundamental flow variables as well as stock prices are heavily influenced by the busi-
ness cycle. One method of dealing with this issue is to “cyclically adjust” the valuation 
measure. The most widely known metric is the cyclically adjusted P/E (CAPE). For this measure, the current price level is divided by the average level of earnings for the last 10 years (adjusted for inflation), rather than by the most current earnings. The idea is to average away cyclical variation in earnings and provide a more reliable base against which to assess the current market price.
Risk Premium Approaches to Equity Returns
The Grinold–Kroner model and similar models are sometimes said to reflect the 
“supply” of equity returns since they outline the sources of return. In contrast, risk premiums reflect “demand” for returns.
Defining and Forecasting the Equity Premium
The term “equity premium” is most frequently used to describe the amount by which 
the expected return on equities exceeds the riskless rate (“equity versus bills”). However, 
the same term is sometimes used to refer to the amount by which the expected return 
on equities exceeds the expected return on default-free bonds (“equity versus bonds”). 
From the discussion of fixed-income building blocks in Sections 3 and 4, we know 
that the difference between these two definitions is the term premium built into the 
expected return on default-free bonds. The equity-versus-bonds premium reflects an 
incremental/building block approach to developing expected equity returns, whereas 
the equity-versus-bills premium reflects a single composite premium for the risk of equity investment.

As with the mean equity returns in Exhibit 3, these historical premiums are subject to substantial estimation error. Statistically, there is no meaningful difference among them. Thus, the long-run cross section of returns/premiums provides virtually no reliable information with which to differentiate among countries.
Since equity returns are much more volatile than returns on either bills or bonds, 
forecasting either definition of the equity premium is just as difficult as projecting 
the absolute level of equity returns. That is, simply shifting to focus on risk premiums 
provides little, if any, specific insight with which to improve forecasts. The analyst must, therefore, use the other modes of analysis discussed here to forecast equity returns/premiums.
An Equilibrium Approach
There are various global/international extensions of the familiar capital asset pricing 
model (CAPM). We will discuss a version proposed by Singer and Terhaar (1997) that is intended to capture the impact of incomplete integration of global markets.
13 The se premiums reflect geometric returns. Therefore, the equity-vs-bills premium is the sum of the term premium and the equity-vs-bonds premium. Premiums using arithmetic returns are systematically higher and are not additive.

The Singer–Terhaar model is actually a combination of two underlying CAPM 
models. The first assumes that all global markets and asset classes are fully integrated. 
The full integration assumption allows the use of a single global market portfolio to 
determine equity-versus-bills risk premiums for all assets. The second underlying CAPM assumes complete segmentation of markets such that each asset class in each country is priced without regard to any other country/asset class. For example, the markets for German equities and German bonds are completely segmented. Clearly, this is a very extreme assumption.
Recall the basic CAPM pricing relationship:
 RPi = βi,MRPM, (2)
wher
e RPi = [E (Ri) − RF] is the risk premium on the i th asset, RPM is the risk pre-
mium on the market portfolio, RF is the risk-free rate, and βi,M—asset i’s sensitivity 
to the market portfolio—is given by
   β  i,M   =   Cov   (   R  i  ,  R  M   )     _  Var   (   R  M   )       =  ρ  i,M     (     σ  i   _  σ  M     )     . (3)
S
tandard deviations are denoted by σ, and ρ denotes correlation.
Under the assumption of full integration, every asset is priced relative to the global 
capitalization-weighted market portfolio. Using Equations 2 and 3 and denoting the 
global market portfolio by “GM , ” the first component of the Singer–Terhaar model is
  R  P  i  G  =  β  i,GM   R  P  GM   =  ρ  i,GM    σ  i     (    R  P  GM   _  σ  GM     )     . (4)
A superscript “G ” has been added on the asset’s risk premium to indicate that it 
reflects the global equilibrium. The term in parentheses on the far right is the Sharpe 
ratio for the global market portfolio, the risk premium per unit of global market risk.
Now consider the case of completely segmented markets. In this case, the risk 
premium for each asset will be determined in isolation without regard to other markets 
or opportunities for diversification. The risk premium will be whatever is required to 
induce investors with access to that market/asset to hold the existing supply. In terms 
of the CAPM framework, this implies treating each asset as its own “market portfolio. ” 
Formally, we can simply set β equal to 1 and ρ equal to 1 in the previous equations 
since each asset is perfectly correlated with itself. Using a superscript “S” to denote the 
segmented market equilibrium and replacing the global market portfolio with asset i itself in Equation 4, the segmented market equilibrium risk premium for asset i  is
  R  P  i  S  = 1 × R  P  i  S  = 1 ×  σ  i     (    R  P  i  S  _  σ  i     )     . (5)
This is the second component of the Singer–Terhaar model. Note that the first equality 
in Equation 5 is an identity; it conveys no information. It reflects the fact that in a 
completely segmented market, the required risk premium could take any value. The second equality is more useful because it breaks the risk premium into two parts: the risk of the asset (σ
i) and the Sharpe ratio (i.e., compensation per unit of risk) in the 
segmented market.14
The final Singer–Terhaar risk premium estimate for asset i  is a weighted average 
of the two component estimates
  R  P  i   = φR  P  i  G  +    (  1 − φ )    R  P  i  S  . (6)
14 A s omewhat more complex model would allow for integration of asset classes within each country. 
Doing so would entail incorporating local market portfolios and allowing assets to be less than perfectly correlated with those portfolios. Equation (5) would then look exactly like equation (4) with the local segmented market portfolio replacing the global market portfolio (“GM”).

To implement the model, the analyst must supply values for the Sharpe ratios in the 
globally integrated market and the asset’s segmented market; the degree to which the 
asset is globally integrated, denoted by φ; the asset’s volatility; and the asset’s β with 
respect to the global market portfolio. A pragmatic approach to specifying the Sharpe 
ratios for each asset under complete integration is to assume that compensation for 
non-diversifiable risk (i.e., “market risk”) is the same in every market. That is, assume all the Sharpe ratios equal the global Sharpe ratio.
In practice, the analyst must make a judgment about the degree of integration/
segmentation—that is, the value of φ in the Singer–Terhaar model. With that in mind, 
some representative values that can serve as starting points for refinement can be helpful. Developed market equities and bonds are highly integrated, so a range of 
0.75–0.90 would be reasonable for φ. Emerging markets are noticeably less integrated, 
especially during stressful periods, and there are likely to be greater differences among 
these markets, so a range of 0.50–0.75 would be reasonable for emerging market equi -
ties and bonds. Real estate market integration is increasing but remains far behind developed market financial assets, perhaps on par with emerging market stocks and bonds overall. In general, relative real estate market integration is likely to reflect the relative integration of the associated financial markets. Commodities for which there are actively traded, high-volume futures contracts should be on the higher end of the integration scale.
To illustrate the Singer–Terhaar model, suppose that an investor has developed 
the following projections for German shares and bonds.
  German 
Shares German Bonds
Volatility (σi) 17.0% 7.0%
Correlation with global market (ρi,M) 0.70 0.50
Degree of integration (φ) 0.85 0.85
Segmented market Sharpe ratio     (  R  P  i  S  /  σ  i   )     0.35 0.25
The risk-free rate is 1.0%, and the investor’s estimate of the global Sharpe ratio is 0.30. 
Note that the investor expects compensation for undiversifiable risk to be higher in 
the German stock market and lower in the German bond market under full segmen-tation. The following are the fully integrated risk premiums for each of the assets (from Equation 4):
 Equities: 0.70 × 17.0% × 0.30 = 3.57%.
 Bonds: 0.50 × 7.0% × 0.30 = 1.05%.
The f
ollowing are the fully segmented risk premiums (from Equation 5):
 Equities: 
17.0% × 0.35 = 5.95%.
 Bonds: 7.0% × 0.25 = 1.75%.
B
ased on 85% integration (φ = 0.85), the final risk estimates (from Equation 6) would 
be as follows:
 Equities: 
(0.85 × 3.57%) + (1 − 0.85) × 5.95% = 3.93%.
 Bonds: 
(0.85 × 1.05%) + (1 − 0.85) × 1.75% = 1.16%.
Adding in the risk-free rate, the expected returns for German shares and bonds would 
be 4.93% and 2.16%, respectively.

Virtually all equilibrium models implicitly assume perfectly liquid markets. Thus, 
the analyst should assess the actual liquidity of each asset class and add appropriate 
liquidity premiums. Although market segmentation and market liquidity are concep -
tually distinct, in practice they are likely to be related. Highly integrated markets are 
likely to be relatively liquid, and illiquidity is one reason that a market may remain segmented.
EXAMPLE 5
Using the Singer–Terhaar Model
1. S tacy Adkins believes the equity market in one of the emerging markets that 
she models has become more fully integrated with the global market. As a result, she expects it to be more highly correlated with the global market. However, she thinks its overall volatility will decline. Her old and new esti-mates are as follows:
 
  Previous Data New Data
Volatility (σi) 22.0% 18.0%
Correlation with global market (ρi,M) 0.50 0.70
Degree of integration (φ) 0.55 0.75
Sharpe ratio (global and segmented markets) 0.30 0.30
 
If she uses the Singer–Terhaar model, what will the net impact of these changes be on her risk premium estimate for this market?
Solution:
The segmented market risk premium will decline from 6.6% (calculated as 22.0% × 0.30 = 6.6%) to 5.4% (= 18% × 0.30). The fully integrated risk premium will increase from 3.30% (= 0.50 × 22.0% × 0.30) to 3.78% (= 0.70 × 18.0% × 0.30). The weighted average premium will decline from 4.79% [= (0.55 × 3.30%) + (0.45 × 6.60%)] to 4.19% [= (0.75 × 3.78%) + (0.25 × 5.40%)], so the net effect is a decline of 60 bps.
Risks in Emerging Market Equities
Most of the issues underlying the risks of emerging market (and “frontier market” if they are classified as such) bonds also present risks for emerging market equities: more fragile economies, lower degree of informational efficiency, less stable political and policy frameworks, and weaker legal protections. However, the risks take some-what different forms because of the different nature of equity and debt claims. Again, note that emerging markets are a very heterogeneous group. The political, legal, and economic issues that are often associated with emerging markets may not, in fact, apply to a particular market or country being analyzed.
There has been a debate about the relative importance of “country” versus “indus -
try” risk factors in global equity markets for over 40 years. The empirical evidence has been summarized quite accurately as “vast and contradictory. ”
15 Both matter, but 
on the whole, country effects still tend to be more important than (global) industry

effects. This is particularly true for emerging markets. Emerging markets are gen-
erally less fully integrated into the global economy and the global markets. Hence, local economic and market factors exert greater influence on risk and return in these markets than in developed markets.
Political, legal, and regulatory weaknesses—in the form of weak standards and/
or weak enforcement—affect emerging market equity investors in various ways. The standards of corporate governance may allow interested parties to manipulate the capital structure of companies and to misuse business assets. Accounting standards 
may allow management and other insiders to hide or misstate important information. 
Weak disclosure rules may also impede transparency and favor insiders. Inadequate property rights laws, lack of enforcement, and weak checks and balances on govern-mental actions may permit seizure of property, nationalization of companies, and prejudicial and unpredictable regulatory actions.
Whereas the emerging market debt investor needs to focus on ability and will-
ingness to pay specific obligations, emerging market equity investors need to focus on variety of risks beyond the traditional credit and counterparty risks, especially in times of macroeconomic and political distress.
EXAMPLE 6
Emerging Market Equity Risks
Bill Dwight has been discussing investment opportunities in Belvia with his colleague, Peter Valt (see Example 3). He is aware that Valt declined to buy the recently issued government bond, but he believes the country’s equities may be attractive. He notes the rapid growth, substantial investment spending, free trade agreement, deregulation, and strong capital inflows as factors favoring 
a strong equity market. In addition, solid global growth has been boosting 
demand for Belvia’s natural resources. Roughly half of the public equity market is represented by companies in the natural resources sector. The other half is a 
reasonably diversified mix of other industries. Many of these firms remain closely 
held, having floated a minority stake on the local exchange in the last few years. Listed firms are required to have published two years of financial statements conforming to standards set by the Belvia Public Accounting Board, which is made up of the heads of the three largest domestic accounting firms. With the help of a local broker, Dwight has identified a diversified basket of stocks that he intends to buy.
Discuss the risks Dwight might be overlooking.
Guideline answer:
Dwight might be overlooking several risks. He is almost certainly underestimat -
ing the vulnerability of the local economy and the vulnerability of the equity market to local developments. The economy’s rapid growth is being driven by a large and growing fiscal deficit, in particular, rapidly rising redistributive social 
payments, and investment spending financed by foreign capital. Appreciation of 
the currency has made industries other than natural resources less competitive, 
so the free trade agreement provides little support for the economy. When the government is forced to tighten fiscal policy or capital flows shrink, the domes -
tic economy is likely to be hit hard. Political risk is also a concern. A return to the prior regime is likely to result in a less pro-growth, less business-friendly environment, which would most likely result in attempts by foreign investors 
to repatriate their capital. Dwight should also have serious concerns about 
corporate governance, given that most listed companies are closely held, with

dominant shareholders posing expropriation risk. He should also be concerned 
about transparency (e.g., limited history available) and accounting standards (local standards set by the auditing firms themselves).
FORECASTING REAL ESTATE RETURNS
explain how economic and competitive factors can affect expectations for real estate investment markets and sector returns
Real estate is inherently quite different from equities, bonds, and cash. It is a physical asset rather than a financial asset. It is heterogeneous, indivisible, and immobile. It is a factor of production, like capital equipment and labor, and as such, it directly produces a return in the form of services. Its services can be sold but can be used/consumed only in one location. Owning and operating real estate involves operating and maintenance costs. All these factors contribute to making real estate illiquid and costly to transfer. The characteristics just described apply to direct investment in real estate (raw land, which does not produce income, is an exception). We will address the investment characteristics of equity REITs versus direct real estate, but unless 
otherwise stated, the focus is on directly held, unlevered, income-producing real estate.
Historical Real Estate Returns
The heterogeneity, indivisibility, immobility, and illiquidity of real estate pose a 
severe problem for historical analysis. Individual properties trade infrequently and erratically in time, so there is little  chance of getting a sequence of simultaneous, periodic (say, quarterly) transaction prices for a cross section of properties. Even in mor e developed real estate markets, there is a tendence for market transactions to occur predominantly in properties with lower to moderate historical price growth. As a result, real estate owners/investors must rely heavily on appraisals, rather than transactions, in valuing properties. Owing to infrequent transactions and the hetero-geneity of properties, these appraisals tend to reflect slowly moving averages of past 
market conditions. As a result, returns calculated from appraisals represent weighted 
averages of (unobservable) “true” returns—returns that would have been observed if there had been transaction prices—in previous periods. This averaging does not, in general, bias the mean return. It does, however, significantly distort estimates of 
volatility and correlations. The published return series is too smooth; that is, the usual 
sample volatility substantially understates the true volatility of returns. Meanwhile, by disguising the timing of response to market information, the smoothing tends to understate the strength of contemporaneous correlation with other market variables and spuriously induce a lead/lag structure of correlations.
In order to undertake any meaningful analysis of real estate as an asset class, the 
analyst must first deal with this data issue. It has become standard to “unsmooth” 
appraisal-based returns using a time-series model. Such techniques, which also apply 
to private equity funds, private debt funds, and hedge funds, are briefly described in a later section.6

Real Estate Cycles
Real estate is subject to cycles that both drive and are driven by the business cycle. 
Real estate is a major factor of production in the economy. Virtually every business requires it. Every household consumes “housing services. ” Demand for the services provided by real estate rises and falls with the pace of economic activity. The supply of real estate is vast but essentially fixed at any point in time.
16 As a result, there is a 
strong cyclical pattern to property values, rents, and occupancy rates. The extent to which this pattern is observable depends on the type of real estate. As emphasized 
previously, changes in property values are obscured by the appraisal process, although 
indications can be gleaned from transactions as they occur. The extent to which actual 
rents and occupancy rates fully reflect the balance of supply and demand depends pri -
marily on the type of property and the quality of the property. High-quality properties 
with long leases will tend to have little turnover, so fluctuations in actual rents and occupancy rates are likely to be relatively small. In contrast, demand for low-quality properties is likely to be more sensitive to the economy, leading to more substantial swings in occupancy and possibly rents as well. Properties with short leases will see rents adjust more completely to current supply/demand imbalances. Room rates and occupancy at low-quality hotels will tend to be the most volatile.
Fluctuations in the balance of supply and demand set up a classic boom–bust cycle 
in real estate. First, the boom: Perceptions of rising demand, property values, lease 
rates, and occupancy induce development of new properties. This investment spending 
helps drive and/or sustain economic activity, which, in turn, reinforces the perceived 
profitability of building new capacity. Then, the bust: Inevitably, optimistic projections 
lead to overbuilding and declining property values, lease rates, and occupancy. Since property has a very long life and is immobile, leases are typically for multiple years and staggered across tenants. In addition, since moving is costly for tenants, it may take many months or years for the excess supply to be absorbed.
A study by Clayton, Fabozzi, Gilberto, Gordon, Hudson-Wilson, Hughes, Liang, 
MacKinnon, and Mansour (2011) suggested that the US commercial real estate crash following the global financial crisis was the first to have been driven by the capital markets rather than by a boom–bust cycle in real estate fundamentals.
17 The catalyst 
was not overbuilding, Clayton et al. argued, but rather excess leverage and investment 
in more speculative types of properties. Consistent with that hypothesis, both the collapse in property prices and the subsequent recovery were unusually rapid. The authors attributed the accelerated response to underlying conditions to appraisers 
responding more vigorously to signals from the REIT and commercial mortgage-backed 
security markets. It remains to be seen whether this phenomenon will persist in less extreme circumstances.
Capitalization Rates
The capitalization (cap) rate, defined as net operating income (NOI) in the current 
period divided by the property value, is the standard valuation metric for commercial 
real estate. It is analogous to EBITDA as a percentage of EV (reciprocal of EV/EBITDA 
valuation multiple) for a typical corporate issuer. It is not, strictly speaking, a cash 
16 Y au, Schneeweis, Szado, Robinson, and Weiss (2018) found that real estate represents from one-third to as much as two-thirds of global wealth.17
 D
ata from the Investment Property Databank indicate that commercial property values dropped by 
21.8% globally and US property values decreased by 33.2% in 2008–2009. Other countries suffered steep losses as well, notably Ireland (55.5%) and Spain (20.1%).

flow yield because a portion of operating income may be reinvested in the property.18 
As with any equity, an estimate of the long-run expected/required rate of return can 
be derived from this ratio by assuming a constant growth rate for NOI—that is, by applying the Gordon growth model.
 E(Rre) = Cap rate + NOI growth rate.  (7)
The long-r
un, steady-state NOI growth rate for commercial real estate as a whole 
should be reasonably close to the growth rate of GDP . The observation that over a 30-year period UK nominal rental income grew about 6.5% per annum, roughly 2.5% in real terms,
19 is consistent with this relationship.
Over finite horizons, it is appropriate to adjust this equation to reflect the antic -
ipated rate of change in the cap rate.
 E(Rre) = Cap rate + NOI growth rate − %ΔCap rate.  (8)
Thi
s equation is analogous to the Grinold–Kroner model for equities, except there is 
no term for share buybacks. The growth rate of NOI could, of course, be split into a real component and inflation.
Exhibit 6 shows private market cap rates as of 30 June 2021 for US commercial 
properties differentiated by type, location, and quality. The rates range from 34.7% for 
industrial properties to 6.8% for retail. The relatively high cap rate for retail reflects 
the investors’ perception that of short-term risks related to in-person shopping during 
the COVID-19 pandemic and longer-term risks related to ecommerce continuing to take market share from in-store retail.

In-store share losses to ecommerce is especially intense for lower-productivity (less profitable) locations. Cap rates for high- and low-productivity shopping malls began to diverge even before the global financial crisis. In 2006, the difference in cap rates was 1.2 percentage points; by 2018, it was 3.2 percentage points.
20
Cap rates reflect long-term discount rates. As such, we should expect them to rise 
and fall with the general level of long-term interest rates, which tends to make them pro-cyclical. However, they are also sensitive to credit spreads and the availability of 
credit. Peyton (2009) found that the spread between cap rates and the 10-year Treasury 
yield is positively related to the option-adjusted spread on three- to five-year B-rated 
corporate bonds and negatively related to ratios of household and non-financial-sector 
18 Ilmanen (2012) indic ated that the difference between cap rates and cash flow yields may be on the order 
of 3 percentage points. Although significant reinvestment of NOI reduces the cash flow yield, it should increase the growth rate of NOI if the investment is productive.19

debt to GDP . The countercyclical nature of credit spreads mitigates the cyclicality of 
cap rates. The debt ratios are effectively proxies for the availability of debt financing for leveraged investment in real estate. Since real estate transactions typically involve substantial leverage, greater availability of debt financing is likely to translate into a lower required liquidity premium component of expected real estate returns. Not surprisingly, higher vacancy rates induce higher cap rates.
The Risk Premium Perspective on Real Estate Expected Return
As a very long-lived asset, real estate is quite sensitive to the level of long-term rates; that is, it has a high effective duration. Indeed, this is often the one and only charac -
teristic mentioned in broad assessments of the likely performance of real estate as an asset class. Hence, real estate must earn a significant term premium. Income-earning properties are exposed to the credit risk of the tenants. In essence, a fixed-term lease 
with a stable stream of payments is like a corporate bond issued by the tenant secured 
with physical assets. The landlord must, therefore, demand a credit premium com-mensurate with what his or her average tenant would have to pay to issue such debt. Real estate must also earn a significant equity risk premium (relative to corporate debt) since the owner bears the full brunt of fluctuations in property values as well as 
uncertainty with respect to rent growth, lease rollover/termination, and vacancies. The 
most volatile component of return arises, of course, from changes in property values. As noted previously, these values are strongly pro-cyclical, which implies the need for a significant equity risk premium. Combining the bond-like components (term premium plus credit premium) with a stock-like component implies a risk premium somewhere between those of corporate bonds and equities.
Liquidity is an especially important risk for direct real estate ownership. There 
are two main ways to view illiquidity. For publicly traded equities and bonds, the question is not whether one can sell the security quickly but, rather, at what price. For real estate, however, it may be better to think of illiquidity as a total inability to sell the asset except at randomly spaced points in time. From this perspective, the degree of liquidity depends on the average frequency of these trading opportunities. By adopting this perspective, one can ask how large the liquidity premium must be to induce investors to hold an asset with a given level of liquidity. Ang, Papanikolaou, and Westerfield (2014) analyzed this question. Their results suggest liquidity premi-ums on the order of 0.60% for quarterly average liquidity, 0.90% for annual liquidity, and 2%, 4%, and 6% for liquidity on average every 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively.
21 
All things considered, a liquidity premium of 2%–4% would seem reasonable for 
commercial real estate.
Real Estate in Equilibrium
Real estate can be incorporated into an equilibrium framework (such as the Singer–Terhaar model). Indeed, doing so might be deemed a necessity given the importance of real estate in global wealth. There are, however, a few important considerations. 
First, the impact of smoothing must have been removed from the risk/return data and 
metrics used for real estate. Otherwise, inclusion of real estate will distort the results 
for all asset classes. Second, it is important to recognize the implicit assumption of fully 
liquid assets in equilibrium models. Adjusting the equilibrium for illiquidity—that is, adding a liquidity premium—is especially important for real estate and other private 
21 S ee Table 3 in Ang et al. (2014). The numbers cited here reflect an assumption of zero correlation between the investor’s liquid and illiquid assets.

assets. Third, although real estate investors increasingly venture outside their home 
markets, real estate is still location specific and may, therefore, be more closely related 
to local, as opposed to global, economic/market factors than are financial claims.
Public vs. Private Real Estate
Many institutional investors and some ultra-wealthy individuals are able to assemble 
diversified portfolios of direct real estate holdings. Investors with smaller portfolios must typically choose between limited, undiversified direct real estate holdings or obtaining real estate exposure through financial instruments, such as REIT shares. 
Assessing whether these alternatives—direct real estate and REITs—have similar 
investment characteristics is difficult because of return smoothing, heterogeneity of properties, and variations in leverage.
A careful analysis of this issue requires (1) transaction-based returns for unlevered 
direct real estate holdings, (2) firm-by-firm deleveraging of REIT returns based on their individual balance sheets over time, and (3) carefully constructing direct real estate and REIT portfolios with matching property characteristics. Exhibit 7 shows the results of such an analysis.

Source: Ling and Naranjo (2015, Table 1).
Deleveraging the REITs substantially reduces both their mean returns and their volatil-
ities. The volatilities are roughly cut in half. Clearly, the deleveraged REIT returns are 
much more similar to the direct real estate returns than are the levered REIT returns. 
In the aggregate, REITs outperformed direct real estate by 49 bps per year with lower 
volatility. Looking at specific property types, REITs had higher returns and lower vol -
atility in two categories—office and retail. Industrial REITs had essentially the same 
return as directly owned industrial properties but with higher volatility. Apartment REITs lagged the direct market but with significantly lower volatility.
Exhibit 7 certainly shows some interesting differences. The pattern of unlevered 
REIT returns by property type is not the same as for direct real estate. Retail REITs had the highest return, and industrial REITs had the lowest. Among directly owned properties, apartments had the highest return and offices the lowest. A similar mis -
match appears with respect to volatilities.
Overall, this study tends to support the general conclusion reached by most com-
parisons: Public and private commercial real estate are different. The extent of the 
difference is less clear. It does appear that once we account for differences in leverage, 
REIT investors are not sacrificing performance to obtain the liquidity afforded by

publicly traded shares. Perhaps REIT investors are able to capture a significant por -
tion of the liquidity risk premium garnered by direct investors (because the REIT is 
a direct investor) as well as benefit from professional management.
What about the diversification benefits of real estate as an asset class? REITs are 
traded securities, and that fact shows up in their much higher short-term correlation with equities. In contrast, direct real estate is often touted as a good diversifier based on the notion that it is not very highly correlated with equities. As noted previously, 
the smoothed nature of most published real estate returns is a major contributor to the 
appearance of low correlation with financial assets, including with REITs. Once that is corrected, however, the correlation is higher, even over reasonably short horizons, such as a quarter or a year. Importantly, REITs are more highly correlated with direct real estate and less highly correlated with equities over multi-year horizons.
22 Thus, 
although REITs tend to act like “stocks” in the short run, they act like “real estate” in the longer run. From a strategic asset allocation perspective, REITs and direct real estate are more comparable than conventional metrics suggest.
Long-Term Housing Returns
Savills World Research (2016) estimated that residential real estate accounts for 75% of the total value of developed properties globally. Most individuals’ homes are their primary, perhaps only, real estate investment. A relatively new database provides a global perspective on the long-term performance of residential real estate (housing), equities, and bonds.
23 The database covers 145 years (1870–2015) and 16 countries.
Jordà, Knoll, Kuvshinov, Schularick, and Taylor (2017) found that residential 
real estate was the best performing asset class over the entire sample period, with a higher real return and much lower volatility than equities. However, performance characteristics differed before and after World War II:
 ■Residential real estate had a higher (lower) real return than equities before (after) World War II.
 ■Residential real estate had a higher real return than equities in every coun-try except Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States over 1950–1980 but a lower return than equities in every country for 1980–2015.
 ■Residential real estate and equities had similar patterns—that is, a strong correlation—prior to the war but a low correlation after the war.
 ■Equity returns became increasingly correlated across countries after the war, but residential real estate returns are essentially uncorrelated across countries.
Exhibit 8 shows the real returns for equities and residential real estate in each 
country since 1950.

EXAMPLE 7
Assessing Real Estate Investments
Tammi Sinclair, an analyst at a large retirement fund, recently attended investor 
presentations by three private real estate firms looking to fund new projects. 
Office Growth Partners specializes in building and owning low-cost, standardized 
office space for firms seeking to place sales representatives in the most rapidly 
growing small population areas across the region. Mega-Box Properties builds 
and owns large, custom-designed distribution facilities for multinational makers 
of brand-name products. The facilities are strategically located near major global 
transportation hubs. Exclusive Elegance Inc. develops and then manages some of 
the world’s most luxurious, sought-after residential buildings in prime locations. 
It never breaks ground on a new property until at least 85% of the units have been 
sold and, to date, has never failed to sell out before construction is complete.
Identify important characteristics of each business that Sinclair will need to 
consider in establishing a required rate of return for each potential investment.
Guideline answer:
Office Growth Partners (OGP) is likely to be a very high-risk investment. It 
essentially chases hot markets, it builds generic office space, and its typical tenants 
(opportunistic sales forces) are apt to opt out as soon as the market cools. All 
these aspects suggest that its business is very exposed to a boom-and-bust cycle. 
It is likely to end up owning properties with persistently high vacancy rates and high turnover. Hence, Sinclair will likely require a rather high expected return on an investment in OGP .
Mega-Box’s business should be fairly stable. The distribution centers are stra -
tegically located and designed to meet the needs of the tenant, which suggests long-term leases and low turnover will benefit both Mega-Box and the tenant

firms. The average credit quality of the tenants—multinational makers of brand-
name products—is likely to be solid and disciplined by the public bond and loan 
markets. All things considered, Sinclair should probably require a significantly 
lower expected return on an investment in Mega-Box than in OGP .
Exclusive Elegance appears to be even lower risk. First, it deals only in the 
very highest-quality, most sought-after properties in prime locations. These 
should be relatively immune to cyclical fluctuations. Second, it does not retain 
ownership of the properties, so it does not bear the equity/ownership risks. Third, 
it is fairly conservative in the riskiest portion of its business—developing new properties. However, Sinclair will need to investigate its record with respect to completing development projects within budget, maintaining properties, and delivering top-quality service to residents.
FORECASTING EXCHANGE RATES
discuss major approaches to forecasting exchange rates
Forecasting exchange rates is generally acknowledged to be especially difficult—so 
difficult that many asset managers either passively accept the impact of currency 
movements on their portfolio returns or routinely hedge out the currency exposure even if doing so is costly.
To get a sense for why exchange rates are so difficult to forecast, it is useful to dis-
tinguish between “money” and the currency in which it is denominated. Like equities 
and bonds, money is an asset denominated in a currency. Currencies are the units of account in which the prices of everything else—goods, services, real assets, finan-cial assets, liabilities, flows, and balances—are quoted. An exchange rate movement changes the values of everything denominated in one currency relative to everything denominated in every other currency. That is a very powerful force. It works in the other direction as well. Anything that affects quantities, prices, or values within one currency relative to those in another will exert some degree of pressure on exchange rates. Perhaps even more importantly, anything that changes expectations of prices, quantities, or values within any currency can change expectations about the future path of currencies, causing an immediate reaction in exchange rates as people adjust their exposures.
Of course, currencies are not abstract accounting ledgers. They are inherently tied to 
governments, financial systems, legal systems, and geographies. The laws, regulations, 
customs, and conventions within and between these systems also influence exchange rates, especially when exchange rates are used as instruments or targets of policy. The consequence of all these aspects is that there is very little firm ground on which to stand for analysts trying to forecast exchange rates. The best we can hope to do is to identify the forces that are likely to be exerting the most powerful influences and assess their relative strength. On a related note, it is not possible to identify mutually exclusive approaches to exchange rate forecasting that are each complete enough to stand alone. Hence, the perspectives discussed in this section should be viewed as complementary rather than as alternatives.7

Focus on Goods and Services, Trade, and the Current Account
There are three primary ways in which trade in goods and services can influence the 
exchange rate. The first is directly through flows. The second is through quasi-arbitrage 
of prices. The third is through competitiveness and sustainability.
Trade Flows
Trade flows do not, in general, exert a significant impact on contemporaneous exchange 
rate movements, provided they can be financed. Although gross trade flows may be 
large, net flows (exports minus imports) are typically much smaller relative to the economy and relative to actual and potential financial flows. If trade-related flows through the foreign exchange market become large relative to financing/investment flows, it is likely that a crisis is emerging.
Purchasing Power Parity
Purchasing power parity (PPP) is based on the notion that the prices of goods and 
services should change at the same rate regardless of currency denomination.24 Thus, 
the expected percentage change in the exchange rate should be equal to the difference in 
expected inflation rates. If we define the real exchange rate as the ratio of price levels 
converted to a common currency, then PPP says that the expected change in the real exchange rate should be zero.
The mechanism underlying PPP is a quasi-arbitrage. Free and competitive trade 
should force alignment of the prices of similar products after conversion to a common 
currency. This is a very powerful force. It works, but it is slow and incomplete. As a result, the evidence indicates that PPP is a poor predictor of exchange rates over short to intermediate horizons but is a better guide to currency movements over progressively longer multi-year horizons.
25
There are numerous reasons for deviations from PPP . The starting point mat -
ters. Relative PPP implicitly assumes that prices and exchange rates are already well aligned. If not, it will take time before the PPP relationship re-emerges. Not all goods are traded, and virtually every country imposes some trade barriers. PPP completely ignores the impact of capital flows, which often exert much more acute pressure on exchange rates over significant periods of time. Finally, economic developments may necessitate changes in the country’s terms of trade; that is, contrary to PPP , the real exchange rate may need to change over time.
The impact of relative purchasing power on exchange rates tends to be most evident 
when inflation differentials are large, persistent, and driven primarily by monetary 
conditions. Under these conditions, PPP may describe exchange rate movements 
reasonably well over all but the shortest horizons. Indeed, the well-known “monetary 
approach” to exchange rates essentially boils down to two assumptions: (1) PPP holds, 
and (2) inflation is determined by the money supply.
Competitiveness and Sustainability of the Current Account
It is axiomatic that in the absence of capital flows prices, quantities, and exchange rates 
would have to adjust so that trade is always balanced. Since the prices of goods and 
services, production levels, and spending decisions tend to adjust only gradually, the onus of adjustment would fall primarily on exchange rates. Allowing for capital flows 
mitigates this pressure on exchange rates. The fact remains, however, that imposition 
24 Thi s version of PPP is usually referred to as “relative PPP” to distinguish it from a stricter notion called 
“absolute PPP . ” Absolute PPP is an important concept but is not useful for practical forecasting. See previous 
CFA Program currency readings for a broader discussion of PPP concepts.25
 S
ee, for example, Abuaf and Jorion (1990); Exhibit 2 in “Currency Exchange Rates: Understanding 
Equilibrium Value” provides a useful visual illustration of PPP over different horizons.

of restrictions on capital flows will increase the sensitivity of exchange rates to the 
trade balance or, more generally, the current account balance.26 This is not usually 
a major consideration for large, developed economies with sophisticated financial markets but can be important in small or developing economies.
Aside from the issue of restrictions on capital mobility, the extent to which the 
current account balance influences the exchange rate depends primarily on whether 
it is likely to be persistent and, if so, whether it can be sustained. These issues, in turn, 
depend mainly on the size of the imbalance and its source. Small current account balances—say, less than 2% of GDP—are likely to be sustainable for many years and 
hence would exert little influence on exchange rates. Similarly, larger imbalances that are 
expected to be transitory may not generate a significant, lasting impact on currencies.
The current account balance equals the difference between national saving and 
investment.27 A current account surplus indicates that household saving plus business 
profits and the government surplus/deficit exceeds domestic investment spending. A current account deficit reflects the opposite. A current account deficit that reflects strong, profitable investment spending is more likely to be sustainable than a deficit reflecting high household spending (low saving), low business profits, or substantial government deficits because it is likely to attract the required capital inflow for as long as attractive investment opportunities persist. A large current account surplus 
may not be very sustainable either because it poses a sustainability problem for deficit 
countries or because the surplus country becomes unwilling to maintain such a high level of aggregate saving.
Whether an imbalance is likely to persist in the absence of terms-of-trade adjust -
ments largely depends on whether the imbalance is structural. Structural imbalances arise from (1) persistent fiscal imbalances; (2) preferences, demographics, and insti-
tutional characteristics affecting saving decisions; (3) abundance or lack of important 
resources; (4) availability/absence of profitable investment opportunities associated with growth, capital deepening, and innovation; and, of course, (5) the prevailing terms of trade. Temporary imbalances mainly arise from business cycles (at home and abroad) and associated policy actions.
If a change in the (nominal) exchange rate is to bring about a necessary change 
in the current account balance, it will have to induce changes in spending patterns, consumption/saving decisions, and production/investment decisions. These adjust -
ments typically occur slowly and are often resisted by decision makers who hope they 
can be avoided. Rapid adjustment of the exchange rate may also be resisted because people only gradually adjust their expectations of its ultimate level. Hence, both the exchange rate and current account adjustments are likely to be gradual.
Focus on Capital Flows
Since the current account and the capital account must always balance and the drivers 
of the current account tend to adjust only gradually, virtually all of the short-term adjustment and much of the intermediate-term adjustment must occur in the capital 
account. Asset prices, interest rates, and exchange rates are all part of the equilibrating 
mechanism. Since a change in the exchange rate simultaneously affects the relative values of all assets denominated in different currencies, we should expect significant pressure to be exerted on the exchange rate whenever an adjustment of capital flows is required.
26 The M undell–Fleming model of monetary and fiscal policy effects on the exchange rate with high/low capital mobility provides an important illustration of this point. See the CFA Program reading “Currency Exchange Rates: Understanding Equilibrium Value. ”27

Implications of Capital Mobility
Capital seeks the highest risk-adjusted expected return. The investments available in 
each currency can be viewed as a portfolio. Designating one as domestic (d ) and one 
as foreign (f ), in a world of perfect capital mobility the exchange rate (expressed as 
domestic currency per foreign currency unit) will be driven to the point at which the expected percentage change in the exchange rate equals the “excess” risk-adjusted 
expected return on the domestic portfolio over the foreign portfolio. This idea can be 
expressed concretely using a building block approach to expected returns.
 E(%Δ
Sd/f) 
 = 
(rd − rf) + (Termd − T ermf) + (Creditd − Creditf) + (Equityd − Equityf) + 
(Liquidd − Liquidf).  
 (9)
The 
expected change in the exchange rate (%ΔSd/f) will reflect the differences in the 
nominal short-term interest rates (r ), term premiums (Τerm), credit premiums (Credit), 
equity premiums (Equity), and liquidity premiums (Liquid) in the two markets. The components of this equation can be associated with the expected return on various segments of the portfolio: the money market (first term), government bonds (first 
and second), corporate bonds (first–third), publicly traded equities (first–fourth), 
and private assets (all terms), including direct investment in plant and equipment.
As an example, suppose the domestic market has a 1% higher short-term rate, 
a 0.25% lower term premium, a 0.50% higher credit premium, and the same equity and liquidity premiums as the foreign market. Equation 9 implies that the domestic currency must be expected to depreciate by 1.25% (= 1% − 0.25% + 0.5%)—that is, E(%ΔS
d/f) = 1.25%—to equalize risk-adjusted expected returns.
It may seem counterintuitive that the domestic currency should be expected to 
depreciate if its portfolio offers a higher risk-adjusted expected return. The puzzle is resolved by the key phrase “driven to the point . . . ” in this subsection’s opening paragraph. In theory, the exchange rate will instantly move (“jump”) to a level where 
the currency with higher (lower) risk-adjusted expected return will be so strong (weak) 
that it will be expected to depreciate (appreciate) going forward. This is known as the overshooting mechanism, introduced by Dornbusch (1976). In reality, the move 
will not be instantaneous, but it may occur very quickly if there is a consensus about the relative attractiveness of assets denominated in each currency. Of course, asset prices will also be adjusting.
The overshooting mechanism suggests that there are likely to be three phases in 
response to relative improvement in investment opportunities. First, the exchange rate 
will appreciate (Sd/f will decline) as capital flows toward the more attractive market. 
The more vigorous the flow, the faster and greater the appreciation of the domestic currency and the more the flow will also drive up asset prices in that market. Second, in the intermediate term, there will be a period of consolidation as investors begin to 
question the extended level of the exchange rate and to form expectations of a reversal. 
Third, in the longer run, there will be a retracement of some or all of the exchange 
rate move depending on the extent to which underlying opportunities have been 
equalized by asset price adjustments. This is the phase that is reflected in Equation 9.
Importantly, these three phases imply that the relationship between currency 
appreciation/depreciation and apparent investment incentives will not always be 
in the same direction. This fact is especially important with respect to interest rate differentials since they are directly observable. At some times, higher–interest rate currencies appreciate; at other times, they depreciate.

Uncovered Interest Rate Parity and Hot Money Flows
Uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) asserts that the expected percentage change in 
the exchange rate should be equal to the nominal interest rate differential. That is, 
only the first term in Equation 9 matters. The implicit assumption is that the response 
to short-term interest rate differentials will be so strong that it overwhelms all other considerations.
Contrary to UIP , the empirical evidence consistently shows that carry trades—
borrowing in low-rate currencies and lending in high-rate currencies—earn meaningful 
profits on average. For example, Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleshchelski, and Rebelo 
(2011) found that from February 1976 to July 2009, a strategy of rolling carry trades 
involving portfolios of high- and low-rate currencies returned 4.31% per annum after 
transaction costs versus the US dollar and 2.88% per annum versus the British pound.
The profitability of carry trades is usually ascribed to a risk premium, which is clearly 
consistent with the idea that the risk premiums in Equation 9 matter. The empirical results may also be capturing primarily the overshooting phase of the response to interest rate differentials. In any case, carry trades tend to be profitable on average, and UIP does not hold up well as a predictor of exchange rates.
Vigorous flows of capital in response to interest rate differentials are often referred 
to as hot moneyflows. Hot money flows are problematic for central banks. First, they limit the central bank’s ability to run an effective monetary policy. This is the key 
message of the Mundell–Fleming model with respect to monetary policy in economies 
characterized by the free flow of capital. Second, a flood of readily available short-term 
financing may encourage firms to fund longer-term needs with short-term money, setting the stage for a crisis when the financing dries up. Third, the nearly inevitable overshooting of the exchange rate is likely to disrupt non-financial businesses. These 
issues are generally most acute for emerging markets since their economies and finan -
cial markets tend to be more fragile. Central banks often try to combat hot money flows by intervening in the currency market to offset the exchange rate impact of the flows. They may also attempt to sterilize the impact on domestic liquidity by selling government securities to limit the growth of bank reserves or maintain a target level 
of interest rates. If the hot money is flowing out rather than in , the central bank would 
do the opposite: sell foreign currency (thereby draining domestic liquidity) to limit/avoid depreciation of the domestic currency and buy government securities (thereby 
providing liquidity) to sterilize the impact on bank reserves and interest rates. In either 
case, if intervention is not effective or sufficient, capital controls may be imposed.
Portfolio Balance, Portfolio Composition, and Sustainability Issues
The earlier discussion on the implications of capital mobility implicitly introduced 
a portfolio balance perspective. Each country/currency has a unique portfolio of 
assets that makes up part of the global “market portfolio. ” Exchange rates provide 
an across-the-board mechanism for adjusting the relative sizes of these portfolios to match investors’ desire to hold them. We will look at this from three angles: tactical allocations, strategic/secular allocations, and the implications of wealth transfer.
The relative sizes of different currency portfolios within the global market portfolio 
do not, in general, change significantly over short to intermediate horizons. Hence, investors do not need to be induced to make changes in their long-term allocations. However, they are likely to want to make tactical allocation changes in response to 
evolving opportunities—notably, those related to the relative strength of various 
economies and related policy measures. Overall, capital is likely to flow into the 
currencies of countries in the strongest phases of the business cycle. The attraction should be especially strong if the economic expansion is led by robust investment in real, productive assets (e.g., plant and equipment) since that can be expected to generate a new stream of long-run profits.

Learning Module 2  C apital Market Expectations, Part 2: Forecasting Asset Class Returns 104
In the long run, the relative size of each currency portfolio depends primarily on 
relative trend growth rates and current account balances. Rapid economic growth is 
almost certain to be accompanied by an expanding share of the global market portfolio 
being denominated in the associated currency. Thus, investors will have to be induced 
to increase their strategic allocations to assets in that country/currency. All else the 
same, this would tend to weaken that currency—partially offsetting the increase in the currency’s share of the global portfolio—and upward pressure on risk premiums in that market. However, there are several mitigating factors.
 ■With growth comes wealth accumulation: The share of global wealth owned by domestic investors will be rising along with the supply of assets denom-inated in their currency. Since investors generally exhibit a strong home country bias for domestic assets, domestic investors are likely to willingly absorb a large portion of the newly created assets.
 ■Productivity-driven growth: If high growth reflects strong productivity gains, both foreign and domestic investors are likely to willingly fund it with both financial flows and foreign direct investment.
 ■Small initial weight in global portfolios: Countries with exceptionally high trend growth rates are typically relatively small, have previously restricted foreign access to their local-currency financial markets, and/or have previously funded external deficits in major currencies (not their own). Almost by definition, these are emerging and frontier markets. Any of these factors would suggest greater capacity to increase the share of local-currency-denominated assets in global portfolios without undermin-ing the currency.
Large, persistent current account deficits funded in local currency will also put 
downward pressure on the exchange rate over time as investors are required to shift 
strategic allocations toward that currency. Again, there are mitigating considerations.
 ■The source of the deficit matters: As discussed previously, current account deficits arising from strong investment spending are relatively easy to finance as long as they are expected to be sufficiently profitable. Deficits due to a low saving rate or weak fiscal discipline are much more problematic.
 ■Special status of reserve currencies: A few currencies—notably, the US dollar—have a special status because the bulk of official reserves are held in these currencies, the associated sovereign debt issuer is viewed as a safe haven, major commodities (e.g., oil) are priced in these currencies, and international trade transactions are often settled in them. A small cur -
rent account deficit in a reserve-currency country is welcome because it helps provide liquidity to the global financial system. Historically, however, reserve currency status has not proven to be permanent.
Current account surpluses/deficits reflect a transfer of wealth from the deficit 
country to the surplus country. In an ideal world of fully integrated markets, perfect capital mobility, homogeneous expectations, and identical preferences,
28 a transfer 
of wealth would have virtually no impact on asset prices or exchange rates because 
everyone would be happy with the same portfolio composition. This is not the case in 
practice. To pick just one example, as long as investors have a home country bias, the 
transfer of wealth will increase the demand for the current-account-surplus country’s 
assets and currency and decrease demand for those of the deficit country.
28 Not e that these are essentially the assumptions underlying the standard CAPM.

Forecasting Exchange Rates 105
Does the composition of a particular currency’s portfolio matter? A look back at 
Equation 9 suggests that it should matter to some degree. For the most part, however, 
we would expect asset price adjustments (changes in interest rates and risk premiums) 
to eliminate most of the pressure that might otherwise be exerted on the exchange 
rate. Nonetheless, some types of flows and holdings are often considered to be more or less supportive of the currency. Foreign direct investment flows are generally con-sidered to be the most favorable because they indicate a long-term commitment and they contribute directly to the productivity/profitability of the economy. Similarly, 
investments in private real estate and private equity represent long-term capital 
committed to the market, although they may or may not represent the creation of new real assets. Public equity would likely be considered the next most supportive of the currency. Although it is less permanent than private investments, it is still a residual claim on the profitability of the economy that does not have to be repaid. 
Debt has to be serviced and must either be repaid or refinanced, potentially triggering 
a crisis. Hence, a high and rising ratio of debt to GDP gives rise to debt sustainability  
concerns with respect to the economy. This issue could apply to private sector debt. But it is usually associated with fiscal deficits because the government is typically the largest single borrower; typically borrows to fund consumption and transfers, rather than productive investment; and may be borrowing in excess of what can be serviced 
without a significant increase in taxes. Finally, as noted previously with respect to hot 
money flows, large or rapid accumulation of short-term borrowing is usually viewed as a clear warning sign for the currency.
EXAMPLE 8
Currency Forecasts
1. Af ter many years of running moderately high current account deficits 
(2%–4% of GDP) but doing little infrastructure investment, Atlandia plans to increase the yearly government deficit by 3% of GDP and maintain that level of deficit for the next 10 years, devoting the increase to infrastructure spending. The deficits will be financed with local-currency government debt. Pete Stevens, CFA, is faced with the task of assessing the impact of this announcement on the Atlandian currency. After talking with members of the economics department at his firm, he has established the following baseline assumptions:
 ■All else the same, current account deficits will persistently exceed 6% of GDP while the program is in place. Setting aside any lasting impact of the policy/spending, the current account deficit will then fall back to 3% of GDP provided the economy has remained competitive.
 ■Pressure on wages will boost inflation to 1.5% above the global infla-tion rate. Because of limitations on factor substitutability, costs in the traded good sector will rise disproportionately.
 ■Expectations of faster growth will raise the equity premium.
 ■The central bank will likely tighten policy—that is, raise rates.

4. Wha t does the overshooting mechanism imply about the path of 
the exchange rate over time? How does this fit with the answers to 
Questions 1–3?
5.
 Wha
t does a sustainability perspective imply?
Solutions:
1. Pur chasing power parity would imply that the Atlandian currency 
will depreciate by 1.5% per year. The exchange rate, quoted in domes -
tic (Atlandian) units per foreign unit as in Equation 9, will rise by a factor of 1.015
10 = 1.1605, corresponding to a 13.83% (= 1 − 1/1.1605) 
decline in the value of the domestic currency.29
2. Sinc e costs in the traded sector will rise faster than inflation, the 
exchange rate would need to depreciate faster than PPP implies in order to maintain competitiveness. Thus, to remain competitive and re-establish a 3% current account deficit after 10 years, the real  
exchange rate needs to depreciate.
3.
 B
oth the increase in short-term rates and the increase in the equity 
premium are likely to induce strong short-term capital inflows even before the current account deficit actually increases. This should put significant pressure on the Atlandian currency to appreciate (i.e., the S
d/f exchange rate will decline if the Atlandian currency is defined 
as the domestic currency). The initial impact may be offset to some extent by flows out of government bonds as investors push yields up in anticipation of increasing supply, but as bonds are repriced to offer a higher expected return (a higher term premium), it will reinforce the upward pressure on the exchange rate.
4.
 The overs
hooting mechanism would imply that the initial appreciation 
of the Atlandian currency discussed previously will extend to a level from which the currency is then expected to depreciate at a pace that equalizes risk-adjusted expected returns across markets and maintains equality between the current and capital accounts. The initial appreci-ation of the currency in this scenario is clearly inconsistent with PPP , but the subsequent longer-term depreciation phase (from a stronger level) is likely to bring the exchange rate into reasonable alignment with PPP and competitiveness considerations in the long run.
5.
 I
t is highly unlikely that a current account deficit in excess of 6% of 
GDP is sustainable for 10 years. It would entail an increase in net foreign liabilities equaling 60% (= 6% × 10) of GDP . Servicing that additional obligation would add, say, 2%–3% of GDP to the current account deficit forever. Adding that to the baseline projection of 3% would mean that the current account deficit would remain in the 5%–6% range even after the infrastructure spending ended, so net foreign liabilities would still be accumulating rapidly. Closing that gap will require a very large increase in net national saving: 5%–6% of annual GDP in addition to the 3% reduction in infrastructure spending when the program ends. Standard macroeconomic analysis implies that such an adjustment would require some combination of a very deep recession and a very large depreciation in the real value of the 
29 Not e that a slightly different number is obtained if the 1.5% rate is applied directly to the foreign currency 
value of the Atlandian currency (i.e., the exchange rate expressed as foreign units per domestic unit). That calculation would give a cumulative depreciation of 14.03% (= 1 − 0.985
10). The difference arises because 
(1/1.015) is not exactly equal to 0.985.

FORECASTING VOLATILITY
discuss methods of forecasting volatility
In some applications, the analyst is concerned with forecasting the variance for only a 
single asset. More often, however, the analyst needs to forecast the variance–covariance 
matrix for several, perhaps many, assets in order to analyze the risk of portfolios. Estimating a single variance that is believed to be constant is straightforward: The 
familiar sample variance is unbiased and its precision can be enhanced by using 
higher-frequency data. The analyst’s task becomes more complicated if the variance is not believed to be constant or the analyst needs to forecast a variance–covariance (VCV) matrix. These issues are addressed in this section. In addition, we elaborate on de-smoothing real estate and other returns.
Estimating a Constant VCV Matrix with Sample Statistics
The simplest and most heavily used method for estimating constant variances and covariances is to use the corresponding sample statistic—variance or covariance—
computed from historical return data. These elements are then assembled into a VCV 
matrix. There are two main problems with this method, both related to sample size. First, given the short to intermediate sample periods typical in finance, the method 
cannot be used to estimate the VCV matrix for large numbers of assets. If the number 
of assets exceeds the number of historical observations, then some portfolios will erroneously appear to be riskless. Second, given typical sample sizes, this method is subject to substantial sampling error. A useful rule of thumb that addresses both of 
these issues is that the number of observations should be at least 10 times the number 
of assets in order for the sample VCV matrix to be deemed reliable. In addition, since 
each element is estimated without regard to any of the others, this method does not address the issue of imposing cross-sectional consistency.
VCV Matrices from Multi-Factor Models
Factor models have become the standard method of imposing structure on the VCV 
matrix of asset returns. From this perspective, their main advantage is that the number 
of assets can be very large relative to the number of observations. The key to making this work is that the covariances are fully determined by exposures to a small num-ber of common factors whereas each variance includes an asset-specific component.
In a model with K  common factors, the return on the ith asset is given by
   r  i   =  α  i   +   ∑ 
k=1  K
   β  ik    F  k    +  ε  i   , (10)8

Learning Module 2  C apital Market Expectations, Part 2: Forecasting Asset Class Returns 108
where αi is a constant intercept, βik is the asset’s sensitivity to the kth factor, Fk 
is the k th common factor return, and εi is a stochastic term with a mean of zero that 
is unique to the i th asset. In general, the factors will be correlated. Given the model, 
the variance of the i th asset is
   σ  i  2  =   ∑ 
m=1  K
    ∑ 
n=1  K
   β  im    β  in    ρ  mn    +  ν  i  2    (1 1)
where ρmn is the covariance between the m th and n th factors and   ν  i  2   is the vari-
ance of the unique component of the i th asset’s return. The covariance between the 
ith and j th assets is
   σ  ij   =   ∑ 
m=1  K
    ∑ 
n=1  K
   β  im    β  jn    ρ  mn      (12)
A
s long as none of the factors are redundant and none of the asset returns are com-
pletely determined by the factors (so 
  ν  i  2  ≠ 0 ), t here will not be any portfolios that 
erroneously appear to be riskless. That is, we will not encounter the first problem 
mentioned in Section 8, with respect to using sample statistics.
Imposing structure with a factor model makes the VCV matrix much simpler. With 
N assets, there are [N (N − 1)/2] distinct covariance elements in the VCV matrix. For 
example, if N  =100, there are 4,950 distinct covariances to be estimated. The factor 
model reduces this problem to estimating [N  × K] factor sensitivities plus [K (K + 1)/2] 
elements of the factor VCV matrix, Ω. With N  = 100 and K  = 5, this would mean 
“only” 500 sensitivities and 15 elements of the factor VCV matrix—almost a 90% reduction in items to estimate. (Of course, we also need to estimate the asset-specific variance terms, 
  ν  i  2  , in order to get the N  variances,   σ  i  2  .) If the factors are chosen well, 
the factor-based VCV matrix will contain substantially less estimation error than the 
sample VCV matrix does.
A well-specified factor model can also improve cross-sectional consistency. To 
illustrate, suppose we somehow know that the true covariance of any asset i with any 
asset j is proportional to asset i ’s covariance with any third asset, k, so
     σ  ij   _  σ  ik     = Constant   (13)
for any assets i , j, and k . We would want our estimates to come as close as possible 
to satisfying this relationship. Sample covariances computed from any given sample 
of returns will not, in general, do so. However, using Equation 12 with only one factor 
(i.e., K = 1) shows that the covariances from a single-factor model will satisfy
     σ  ij   _  σ  ik     =    β  j  
 _  β  k      (14)
for all assets i , j, and k. Thus, in this simple example, a single-factor model imposes 
exactly the right cross-sectional structure.
The benefits obtained by imposing a factor structure—handling large numbers of 
assets, a reduced number of parameters to be estimated, imposition of cross-sectional 
structure, and a potentially substantial reduction of estimation error—come at a cost. 
In contrast to the simple example just discussed, in general, the factor model will 
almost certainly be mis-specified. The structure it imposes will not be exactly right. As a result, the factor-based VCV matrix is biased; that is, the expected value is not equal to the true (unobservable) VCV matrix of the returns. To put it differently, the matrix is not correct even “on average. ” The matrix is also inconsistent; that is, it does not converge to the true matrix as the sample size gets arbitrarily large. In contrast, 
the sample VCV matrix is unbiased and consistent. Thus, when we use a factor-based 
matrix instead of the sample VCV matrix, we are choosing to estimate something that 
is “not quite right” with relative precision rather than the “right thing” with a lot of 
noise. The point is that although factor models are very useful, they are not a panacea.

Shrinkage Estimation of VCV Matrices
As with shrinkage estimation in general, the idea here is to combine the information in 
the sample data, the sample VCV matrix, with an alternative estimate, the target VCV 
matrix—which reflects assumed “prior” knowledge of the structure of the true VCV 
matrix—and thereby mitigate the impact of estimation error on the final matrix. Each 
element (variance or covariance) of the final shrinkage estimate of the VCV matrix is 
simply a weighted average of the corresponding elements of the sample VCV matrix and the target VCV matrix. The same weights are used for all elements of the matrix. 
The analyst must determine how much weight to put on the target matrix (the “prior” 
knowledge) and how much weight to put on the sample data (the sample VCV matrix).
Aside from a technical condition that rules out the appearance of riskless portfo-
lios, virtually any choice of target VCV matrix will increase (or at least not decrease) the efficiency of the estimates versus the sample VCV matrix. “Efficiency” in this context means a smaller mean-squared error (MSE), which is equal to an estimator’s variance plus the square of its bias. Although the shrinkage estimator is biased, its MSE will in general be smaller than the MSE of the (unbiased) sample VCV matrix. 
The more plausible (and presumably less biased) the selected target matrix, the greater 
the improvement will be. A factor-model-based VCV matrix would be a reasonable candidate for the target.
EXAMPLE 9
Estimating the VCV Matrix
1. Isa B erkitz is an analyst at Barnsby & Culp (B&C), a recently formed 
multi-family office. Berkitz has been asked to propose the method for esti-mating the variance–covariance matrix to be used in B&C’s asset allocation process for all clients. After examining the existing client portfolios and talking with the clients and portfolio managers, Berkitz concludes that in or-der to support B&C’s strategic and tactical allocation needs, the VCV matrix will need to include 25 asset classes. For many of these classes, she will be able to obtain less than 10 years of monthly return data. Berkitz has decided to incorporate both the sample statistics and factor-model approaches using shrinkage estimation.
Explain the strengths and weaknesses of the two basic approaches and why 
Berkitz would choose to combine them using the shrinkage framework.
Solution:
The VCV matrix based on sample statistics is correct on average (it is unbiased) and convergences to the true VCV matrix as the sample size gets arbitrarily large (it is “consistent”). The sample VCV method cannot be used if the number of assets exceeds the number of observations, which is not an issue in this case. However, it is subject to large sampling errors unless the number of observations is large relative to the number of assets. A 10-to-1 rule of thumb would suggest that Berkitz needs more than 250 observations (20+ years of monthly data) in order for the sample VCV matrix to give her reliable estimates, but she has at most 120 observations. In addition, the sample VCV matrix does not impose any cross-sectional consistency on the estimates. A factor-model-based VCV matrix can be used even if the num-ber of assets exceeds the number of observations. It can substantially reduce the number of unique parameters to be estimated, it imposes cross-sec-tional structure, and it can substantially reduce estimation errors. However,

Learning Module 2  C apital Market Expectations, Part 2: Forecasting Asset Class Returns 110
unless the structure imposed by the factor model is exactly correct, the VCV 
matrix will not be correct on average (it will be biased). Shrinkage estima-tion—a weighted average of the sample VCV and factor-based VCV matri-ces—will increase (or at least not decrease) the efficiency of the estimates. In effect, the shrinkage estimator captures the benefits of each underlying methodology and mitigates their respective limitations.
Estimating Volatility from Smoothed Returns
The available return data for such asset classes as private real estate, private equity, and 
hedge funds generally reflect smoothing of unobservable underlying “true” returns. The smoothing dampens the volatility of the observed data and distorts correlations with other assets. Thus, the raw data tend to understate the risk and overstate the 
diversification benefits of these asset classes. Failure to adjust for the impact of 
smoothing will almost certainly lead to distorted portfolio analysis and hence poor asset allocation decisions.
The basic idea is that the observed returns are a weighted average of current and 
past true, unobservable returns. One of the simplest and most widely used models implies that the current observed return, R
t, is a weighted average of the current true 
return, rt, and the previous observed return:
   R  t   =    (  1 − λ )     r  t   + λ  R  t−1   , (15)
wher
e 0 < λ < 1. From this equation, it can be shown that
  var
   (  r )     =    (    1 + λ _ 1 − λ   )    var   (  R )     > var    (  R )     . (16)
A
s an example, if λ = 0.8, then the true variance, var(r ), of the asset is 9 times the 
variance of the observed data. Equivalently, the standard deviation is 3 times larger.
This model cannot be estimated directly because the true return, rt, is not observ -
able. To get around this problem, the analyst assumes a relationship between the 
unobservable return and one or more observable variables. For private real estate, a natural choice might be a REIT index, whereas for private equity, an index of similar publicly traded equities could be used.
EXAMPLE 10
Estimating Volatility from Smoothed Data
While developing the VCV matrix for B&C, Isa Berkitz noted that the volatilities 
for several asset classes—notably, real estate and private equity categories—cal -
culated directly from available return data appear to be very low. The data are from reputable sources, but Berkitz is skeptical because similar publicly traded classes—for example, REITs and small-cap equities—exhibit much higher vol-atilities. What is the likely cause of the issue?
Guideline answer:
The very low volatilities are very likely due to smoothing within the reported pri -
vate asset returns. That is, the observed data reflect a weighted average of current 
and past true returns. For real estate, this smoothing arises primarily because the underlying property values used to calculate “current” returns are based primarily on backward-looking appraisals rather than concurrent transactions.

Time-Varying Volatility: ARCH Models
The discussion up to this point has focused on estimating variances and covariances 
under the assumption that their true values do not change over time. It is well known, 
however, that financial asset returns tend to exhibit volatility clustering, evidenced 
by periods of high and low volatility. A class of models known collectively as autore-
gressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models has been developed to address 
these time-varying volatilities.30
One of the simplest and most heavily used forms of this broad class of models 
specifies that the variance in period t is given by
    σ  t  2  = γ + α  σ  t−1  2   + β  η  t  2 
   
= γ +    (  α + β )     σ  t−1  2   + β   (   η  t  2  −  σ  t−1  2   )      ,
 (17)
wher
e α, β, and γ are non-negative parameters such that (α + β) < 1. The term ηt 
is the unexpected component of return in period t ; that is, it is a random variable with 
a mean of zero conditional on information at time (t  − 1). Rearranging the equation 
as in the second line shows that 
    (   η  t  2  −  σ  t−1  2   )      c an be interpreted as the “shock” to the 
variance in period t . Thus, the variance in period t depends on the variance in period 
(t − 1) plus a shock. The parameter β controls how much of the current “shock” feeds 
into the variance. In the extreme, if β = 0, then variance would be deterministic. The 
quantity (α + β) determines the extent to which the variance in future periods is 
influenced by the current level of volatility. The higher (α + β) is, the more the variance 
“remembers” what happened in the past and the more it “clusters” at high or low levels. The unconditional expected value of the variance is [γ/(1 − α − β)].
As an example, assume that γ = 0.000002, α = 0.9, and β = 0.08 and that we are 
estimating daily equity volatility. Given these parameters, the unconditional expected 
value of the variance is 0.0001, implying that the daily standard deviation is 1% (0.01). 
Suppose the estimated variance at time (t  − 1) was 0.0004 (= 0.022) and the return in 
period t was 3% above expectations (ηt = 0.03). Then the variance in period t  would be
   σ  t  2   = 0.000002 + (0.9 × 0.0004) + (0.08 × 0.032) = 0.000434,
which is equivalent to a standard deviation of 2.0833%. Without the shock to 
the variance (i.e., with   η  t  2  =  σ  t−1  2    = 0.0004), t he standard deviation would have been 
1.9849%. Even without the shock, the volatility would have remained well above its 
long-run mean of 1.0%. Including the shock, the volatility actually increased. Note that 
the impact on volatility would have been the same if the return had been 3% below  
expectations rather than above expectations.
The ARCH methodology can be extended to multiple assets—that is, to estimation 
of a VCV matrix. The most straightforward extensions tend to be limited to only a 
few assets since the number of parameters rises very rapidly. However, Engle (2002) 
developed a class of models with the potential to handle large matrices with relatively 
few parameters.
EXAMPLE 11
ARCH
Sam Akai has noticed that daily returns for a variety of asset classes tend to exhibit periods of high and low volatility but the volatility does seem to revert 
toward a fairly stable average level over time. Many market participants capture 
this tendency by estimating volatilities using a 60-day moving window. Akai 
30 C hapter 12 of Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997) provides an excellent, detailed explanation of these models. The present discussion draws on that book.

Learning Module 2  C apital Market Expectations, Part 2: Forecasting Asset Class Returns 112
notes that this method implicitly assumes volatility is constant within each 
60-day window but somehow not constant from one day to the next. He has 
heard that ARCH models can explicitly incorporate time variation and capture the observed clustering pattern.
Explain the models to him.
Guideline answer:
The key idea is to model variance as a linear time-series process in which the 
current volatility depends on its own recent history or recent shocks. The shocks 
to volatility arise from unexpectedly large or small returns. In one of the sim-plest ARCH models, the current variance depends only on the variance in the 
previous period and the unexpected component of the current return (squared). 
Provided the coefficients are positive and not “too large, ” the variance will exhibit 
the properties Akai has observed: periods of time at high/low levels relative to a well-defined average level.
ADJUSTING A GLOBAL PORTFOLIO
recommend and justify changes in the component weights of a global investment portfolio based on trends and expected changes in macroeconomic factors
The coverage of capital market expectations has provided an intensive examination of topics with which analysts need to be familiar in order to establish capital market expectations for client portfolios. This section brings some of this material together to illustrate how analysts can develop and justify recommendations for adjusting a portfolio. The discussion that follows is selective in the range of assets and scenar -
ios it considers. It focuses on connecting expectations to the portfolio and is about “direction of change” rather than the details of specific forecasts.
Macro-Based Recommendations
Suppose we start with a fairly generic portfolio of global equities and bonds (we assume 
no other asset classes are included or considered) and we are asked to recommend changes based primarily on macroeconomic considerations. Further assume that the portfolio reflects a reasonable strategic allocation for our clients. Hence, we do not need to make any wholesale changes and can focus on incremental improvements based on assessment of current opportunities. To be specific, we limit our potential recommendations to the following:
 ■Change the overall allocations to equities and bonds.
 ■Reallocate equities/bonds between countries.
 ■Adjust the average credit quality of our bond portfolios.
 ■Adjust duration and positioning on the yield curves.
 ■Adjust our exposures to currencies.
To approach the task systematically, we begin with a checklist of questions.
1.
 H
ave there been significant changes in the drivers of trend growth, globally 
or in particular countries?9

Adjusting a Global Portfolio 113
2. Ar e any of the markets becoming more/less globally integrated?
3.
 Wher
e does each country stand within its business cycle? Are they 
synchronized?
4.
 Ar
e monetary and fiscal policies consistent with long-term stability and the 
phases of the business cycle?
5.
 Ar
e current account balances trending and sustainable?
6.
 Ar
e any currencies under pressure to adjust or trending? Have capital 
flows driven any currencies to extended levels? Have any of the economies 
become uncompetitive/super-competitive because of currency movements?
There are certainly many more questions we could ask. In practice, the analyst will 
need to look into the details. But these questions suffice for our illustration. We will 
examine each in turn. It must be noted, however, that they are inherently interrelated.
Trend Growth
All else the same, an increase in trend growth favors equities because it implies more 
rapid long-run earnings growth. Faster growth due to productivity is especially ben-eficial. In contrast, higher trend growth generally results in somewhat higher real 
interest rates, a negative for currently outstanding bonds. Identifiable changes in 
trend growth that have not already been fully factored into asset prices are most likely 
to have arisen from a shock (e.g., new technology). A global change would provide a basis for adjusting the overall equity/bond allocation. Country-specific or regional 
changes provide a basis for reallocation within equities toward the markets experienc -
ing enhanced growth prospects that have not already been reflected in market prices.
Global Integration
All else the same, the Singer–Terhaar model implies that when a market becomes 
more globally integrated, its required return should decline. As prices adjust to a lower 
required return, the market should deliver an even higher return than was previously 
expected or required by the market. Therefore, expected increases in integration 
provide a rationale for adjusting allocations toward those markets and reductions in 
markets that are already highly integrated. Doing so will typically entail a shift from developed markets to emerging markets.
Phases of the Business Cycle
The best time to buy equities is generally when the economy is approaching the trough 
of the business cycle. Valuation multiples and expected earnings growth rates are low 
and set to rise. The Grinold–Kroner model could be used to formalize a recommen-
dation to buy equities. At this stage of the cycle, the term premium is high (the yield curve is steep) and the credit premium is high (credit spreads are wide). However, (short-term) interest rates are likely to start rising soon and the yield curve can be expected to flatten again as the economy gains strength. All else the same, the overall allocation to bonds will need to be reduced to facilitate the increased allocation to 
equities. Within the bond portfolio, overall duration should be reduced, positions with 
intermediate maturities should be reduced in favor of shorter maturities (and perhaps 
a small amount of longer maturities) to establish a “barbell” posture with the desired duration, and exposure to credit should be increased (a “down in quality” trade). The opposite recommendations would apply when the analyst judges that the economy is at or near the peak of the cycle.
To the extent that business cycles are synchronized across markets, this same pre -
scription would apply to the overall portfolio. It is likely, however, that some markets will be out of phase—leading or lagging other markets—by enough to warrant real-locations between markets. In this case, the recommendation would be to reallocate

Learning Module 2  C apital Market Expectations, Part 2: Forecasting Asset Class Returns 114
equities from (to) markets nearest the peak (trough) of their respective cycles and to 
do the opposite within the bond portfolio with corresponding adjustments to duration, 
yield curve positioning, and credit exposure within each market.
Monetary and Fiscal Policies
Investors devote substantial energy dissecting every nuance of monetary and fiscal 
policy. If policymakers are doing what we would expect them to be doing at any 
particular stage of the business cycle—for example, moderate countercyclical actions 
and attending to longer-term objectives, such as controlling inflation and maintaining 
fiscal discipline—their activities may already be reflected in asset prices. In addition, 
the analyst should have factored expected policy actions into the assessment of trend growth and business cycles.
Significant opportunities to add value by reallocating the portfolio are more likely 
to arise from structural policy changes (e.g., a shift from interest rate targeting to money growth targeting, quantitative easing, and restructuring of the tax code) or 
evidence that the response to policy measures is not within the range of outcomes that 
policymakers would have expected (e.g., if massive quantitative easing induced little 
inflation response). Structural policy changes are clearly intentional and the impact on 
the economy and the markets is likely to be consistent with standard macroeconomic 
analysis, so the investment recommendations will follow from the implications for growth trends and business cycles. Almost by definition, standard modes of analysis 
may be ineffective if policy measures have not induced the expected responses. In this 
case, the analyst’s challenge is to determine what, why, and how underlying linkages have changed and identify the value-added opportunities.
Current Account Balances
Current account balances ultimately reflect national saving and investment decisions, 
including the fiscal budget. Current accounts must, of course, net out across countries. 
In the short run, this is brought about in large measure by the fact that household 
saving and corporate profits (business saving) are effectively residuals whereas con-
sumption and capital expenditures are more explicitly planned. Hence, purely cyclical 
fluctuations in the current account are just part of the business cycle. Longer-term trends in the current account require adjustments to induce deliberate changes in saving/investment decisions. A rising current account deficit will tend to put upward pressure on real required returns (downward pressure on asset prices) in order to 
induce a higher saving rate in the deficit country (to mitigate the widening deficit) and 
to attract the increased flow of capital from abroad required to fund the deficit. An expanding current account surplus will, in general, require the opposite in order to reduce “excess” saving. This suggests that the analyst should consider reallocation of portfolio assets from countries with secularly rising current account deficits to those with secularly rising current account surpluses (or narrowing deficits).
Capital Accounts and Currencies
Setting aside very high inflation situations in which purchasing power parity may 
be important even in the short term, currencies are primarily influenced by capital flows. When investors perceive that the portfolio of assets denominated in a partic -
ular currency offers a higher risk-adjusted expected return than is available in other 
currencies, the initial surge of capital tends to drive the exchange rate higher, often to 
a level from which it is more likely to depreciate rather than continue to appreciate. 
At that point, the underlying assets may remain attractive in their native currency but 
not in conjunction with the currency exposure. An analyst recommending reallocation 
of a portfolio toward assets denominated in a particular currency must, therefore, assess whether the attractiveness of the assets has already caused an “overshoot” in

Adjusting a Global Portfolio 115
the currency or whether a case can be made that there is meaningful appreciation yet 
to come. In the former case, the analyst needs to consider whether the assets remain 
attractive after taking account of the cost of currency hedging.
There is one final question that needs to be addressed for all asset classes and 
currencies. The previous discussion alluded to it, but it is important enough to be asked directly: What is already reflected in asset prices? There is no avoiding the fact that valuations matter.
Quantifying the Views
Although the analyst may not be required to quantify the views underlying his or her recommendations, we can very briefly sketch a process that may be used for doing so using some of the tools discussed in earlier sections.

SUMMARY
The following are the main points covered in the reading.
 ■The choice among forecasting techniques is effectively a choice of the infor -
mation on which forecasts will be conditioned and how that information will be incorporated into the forecasts.
 ■The formal forecasting tools most commonly used in forecasting capital market returns fall into three broad categories: statistical methods, dis -
counted cash flow models, and risk premium models.
 ■Sample statistics, especially the sample mean, are subject to substantial estimation error.
 ■Shrinkage estimation combines two estimates (or sets of estimates) into a more precise estimate.

 ■Time-series estimators, which explicitly incorporate dynamics, may summa-
rize historical data well without providing insight into the underlying drivers of forecasts.
 ■Discounted cash flow models are used to estimate the required return implied by an asset’s current price.
 ■The risk premium approach expresses expected return as the sum of the risk-free rate of interest and one or more risk premiums.
 ■There are three methods for modeling risk premiums: equilibrium models, such as the CAPM; factor models; and building blocks.
 ■The DCF method is the only one that is precise enough to use in support of trades involving individual fixed-income securities.
 ■There are three main methods for developing expected returns for fixed-income asset classes: DCF, building blocks, and inclusion in an equi-librium model.
 ■As a forecast of bond return, YTM, the most commonly quoted metric, can be improved by incorporating the impact of yield changes on reinvestment of cash flows and valuation at the investment horizon.
 ■The building blocks for fixed-income expected returns are the short-term default-free rate, the term premium, the credit premium, and the liquidity premium.
 ■Term premiums are roughly proportional to duration, whereas credit premi-ums tend to be larger at the short end of the curve.
 ■Both term premiums and credit premiums are positively related to the slope of the yield curve.
 ■Credit spreads reflect both the credit premium (i.e., additional expected return) and expected losses due to default.
 ■A baseline estimate of the liquidity premium can be based on the yield spread between the highest-quality issuer in a market (usually the sovereign) and the next highest-quality large issuer (often a government agency).
 ■Emerging market debt exposes investors to heightened risk with respect to both ability to pay and willingness to pay, which can be associated with the economy and political/legal weaknesses, respectively.
 ■The Grinold–Kroner model decomposes the expected return on equities into three components: (1) expected cash flow return, composed of the dividend yield minus the rate of change in shares outstanding, (2) expected return due to nominal earnings growth, and (3) expected repricing return, reflecting the rate of change in the P/E.
 ■Forecasting the equity premium directly is just as difficult as projecting the absolute level of equity returns, so the building block approach provides little, if any, specific insight with which to improve equity return forecasts.
 ■The Singer–Terhaar version of the international capital asset pricing model combines a global CAPM equilibrium that assumes full market integration with expected returns for each asset class based on complete segmentation.
 ■Emerging market equities expose investors to the same underlying risks as emerging market debt does: more fragile economies, less stable political and policy frameworks, and weaker legal protections.

 ■Emerging market investors need to pay particular attention to the ways in 
which the value of their ownership claims might be expropriated. Among the areas of concern are standards of corporate governance, accounting and disclosure standards, property rights laws, and checks and balances on governmental actions.
 ■Historical return data for real estate is subject to substantial smoothing, which biases standard volatility estimates downward and distorts correla-tions with other asset classes. Meaningful analysis of real estate as an asset class requires explicit handling of this data issue.
 ■Real estate is subject to boom–bust cycles that both drive and are driven by the business cycle.
 ■The cap rate, defined as net operating income in the current period divided by the property value, is the standard valuation metric for commercial real estate.
 ■A model similar to the Grinold–Kroner model can be applied to estimate the expected return on real estate:
 E(Rre) = Cap rate + NOI growth rate − %ΔCap rate. 
 ■There is a clear pattern of higher cap rates for riskier property types, lower-quality properties, and less attractive locations.
 ■Real estate expected returns contain all the standard building block risk premiums:
 ●Term premium: As a very long-lived asset with relatively stable cash flows, income-producing real estate has a high duration.
 ●Credit premium: A fixed-term lease is like a corporate bond issued by the leaseholder and secured by the property.
 ●Equity premium: Owners bear the risk of property value fluctuations, as well as risk associated with rent growth, lease renewal, and vacancies.
 ●Liquidity premium: Real estate trades infrequently and is costly to transact.
 ■Currency exchange rates are especially difficult to forecast because they are tied to governments, financial systems, legal systems, and geographies. Forecasting exchange rates requires identification and assessment of the forces that are likely to exert the most influence.
 ■Provided they can be financed, trade flows do not usually exert a significant impact on exchange rates. International capital flows are typically larger and more volatile than trade-financing flows.
 ■PPP is a poor predictor of exchange rate movements over short to interme-diate horizons but is a better guide to currency movements over progres -
sively longer multi-year horizons.
 ■The extent to which the current account balance influences the exchange rate depends primarily on whether it is likely to be persistent and, if so, whether it can be sustained.
 ■Capital seeks the highest risk-adjusted expected return. In a world of perfect capital mobility, in the long run, the exchange rate will be driven to the point at which the expected percentage change equals the “excess” risk-adjusted expected return on the portfolio of assets denominated in the domestic currency over that of the portfolio of assets denominated in the foreign currency. However, in the short run, there can be an exchange rate overshoot in the opposite direction as hot money chases higher returns.

 ■Carry trades are profitable on average, which is contrary to the predictions 
of uncovered interest rate parity.
 ■Each country/currency has a unique portfolio of assets that makes up part of the global “market portfolio. ” Exchange rates provide an across-the-board mechanism for adjusting the relative sizes of these portfolios to match investors’ desire to hold them.
 ■The portfolio balance perspective implies that exchange rates adjust in response to changes in the relative sizes and compositions of the aggregate portfolios denominated in each currency.
 ■The sample variance–covariance matrix is an unbiased estimate of the true VCV structure; that is, it will be correct on average.
 ■There are two main problems with using the sample VCV matrix as an esti-mate/forecast of the true VCV matrix: It cannot be used for large numbers of asset classes, and it is subject to substantial sampling error.
 ■Linear factor models impose structure on the VCV matrix that allows them to handle very large numbers of asset classes. The drawback is that the VCV matrix is biased and inconsistent unless the assumed structure is true.
 ■Shrinkage estimation of the VCV matrix is a weighted average of the sample VCV matrix and a target VCV matrix that reflects assumed “prior” knowl-edge of the true VCV structure.
 ■Failure to adjust for the impact of smoothing in observed return data for real estate and other private assets will almost certainly lead to distorted portfolio analysis and hence poor asset allocation decisions.
 ■Financial asset returns exhibit volatility clustering, evidenced by periods of high and low volatilities. ARCH models were developed to address these time-varying volatilities.
 ■One of the simplest and most used ARCH models represents today’s vari-ance as a linear combination of yesterday’s variance and a new “shock” to volatility. With appropriate parameter values, the model exhibits the volatil-ity clustering characteristic of financial asset returns.

PRACTICE PROBLEMS
The following information relates to questions 
1-2
An investor is considering adding three new securities to her internationally fo-cused fixed income portfolio. She considers the following non-callable securities:
 ■1-year government bond
 ■10-year government bond
 ■10-year BBB rated corporate bond
She plans to invest equally in all three securities being analyzed or will invest in none of them at this time. She will only make the added investment provided that the expected spread/premium of the equally weighted investment is at least 1.5 percent (150bp) over the 1-year government bond. She has gathered the follow-ing information:
Risk free interest rate (1-year, incorporating 0.6% inflation expectation) 1.0%
Term premium (10-year vs. 1-year government bond) 1%
10-year BBB credit premium (over 10-year government bond) 75bp
Estimated liquidity premium on 10-year corporate bonds 55bp
Using only the information given, address the following problems using the risk premium approach:
1.
 C
alculate the expected return that an equal-weighted investment in the three 
securities could provide.
2.
 C
alculate the expected total risk premium of the three securities and determine 
the investor’s probable course of action.
The following information relates to questions 3-10
Richard Martin is chief investment officer for the Trunch Foundation (the foundation), which has a large, globally diversified investment portfolio. Martin meets with the foundation’s fixed-income and real estate portfolio managers to review expected return forecasts and potential investments, as well as to consider short-term modifications to asset weights within the total fund strategic asset allocation.
Martin asks the real estate portfolio manager to discuss the performance char-
acteristics of real estate. The real estate portfolio manager makes the following statements:
Statement 1
 A
dding traded REIT securities to an equity portfolio should 
substantially improve the portfolio’s diversification over the next 
year.
© CFA Institute. For candidate use only. Not for distribution.
Practice Problems 121
Statement 2  T raded REIT securities are more highly correlated with direct 
real estate and less highly correlated with equities over multi-
year horizons.
Martin looks over the long-run valuation metrics the manager is using for com-
mercial real estate, shown in Exhibit 1.
Exhibit 1: Commercial Real Estate Valuation Metrics
Cap Rate GDP Growth Rate
4.70% 4.60%
The real estate team uses an in-house model for private real estate to estimate the true volatility of returns over time. The model assumes that the current observed return equals the weighted average of the current true return and the previous observed return. Because the true return is not observable, the model assumes a relationship between true returns and observable REIT index returns; therefore, it uses REIT index returns as proxies for both the unobservable current true return and the previous observed return.
Martin asks the fixed-income portfolio manager to review the foundation’s bond 
portfolios. The existing aggregate bond portfolio is broadly diversified in domes-tic and international developed markets. The first segment of the portfolio to be reviewed is the domestic sovereign portfolio. The bond manager notes that there is a market consensus that the domestic yield curve will likely experience a single 20 bp increase in the near term as a result of monetary tightening and then remain relatively flat and stable for the next three years. Martin then reviews duration and yield measures for the short-term domestic sovereign bond portfo-lio in Exhibit 2.
Exhibit 2: Short-Term Domestic Sovereign Bond Portfolio
Macaulay Duration Modified Duration Yield to Maturity
3.00 2.94 2.00%
The discussion turns to the international developed fixed-income market. The foundation invested in bonds issued by Country XYZ, a foreign developed coun-try. XYZ’s sovereign yield curve is currently upward sloping, and the yield spread between 2-year and 10-year XYZ bonds is 100 bps.
The fixed-income portfolio manager tells Martin that he is interested in a domes-
tic market corporate bond issued by Zeus Manufacturing Corporation (ZMC). ZMC has just been downgraded two steps by a major credit rating agency. In addition to expected monetary actions that will raise short-term rates, the yield spread between three-year sovereign bonds and the next highest-quality govern-ment agency bond widened by 10 bps.
Although the foundation’s fixed-income portfolios have focused primarily on 
developed markets, the portfolio manager presents data in Exhibit 3 on two emerging markets for Martin to consider. Both economies increased exports of their mineral resources over the last decade.

Foreign exchange reserves 90.30% of short-term debt 70.10% of short-term debt
The fixed-income portfolio manager also presents information on a new invest-
ment opportunity in an international developed market. The team is considering the bonds of Xdelp, a large energy exploration and production company. Both the domestic and international markets are experiencing synchronized growth in GDP midway between the trough and the peak of the business cycle. The foreign country’s government has displayed a disciplined approach to maintaining stable monetary and fiscal policies and has experienced a rising current account surplus and an appreciating currency. It is expected that with the improvements in free cash flow and earnings, the credit rating of the Xdelp bonds will be upgraded. Martin refers to the foundation’s asset allocation policy in Exhibit 4 before mak-ing any changes to either the fixed-income or real estate portfolios.

o Akumba’s portfolio is invested in a range of developed markets fixed income

ments to include emerging and frontier markets government and corporate fixed income securities. Her adviser makes the following comment regarding risk:
“ All emerging and frontier market fixed income securities pose economic, po-
litical and legal risk. Economic risks arise from the fact that emerging market countries have poor fiscal discipline, rely on foreign borrowing, have less diverse tax base and significant dependence on specific industries. They are susceptible to capital flight. Their ability to pay is limited. In addition, weak property rights, weak enforcement of contract laws and political instability pose hazard for emerging markets debt investors. ”

18-25
Judith Bader is a senior analyst for a company that specializes in managing international developed and emerging markets equities. Next week, Bader must present proposed changes to client portfolios to the Investment Com-mittee, and she is preparing a presentation to support the views underlying her recommendations.
Bader begins by analyzing portfolio risk. She decides to forecast a variance–
covariance matrix (VCV) for 20 asset classes, using 10 years of monthly returns and incorporating both the sample statistics and the factor-model methods. To mitigate the impact of estimation error, Bader is considering combining the results of the two methods in an alternative target VCV matrix, using shrinkage estimation.  
Bader asks her research assistant to comment on the two approaches and the 
benefits of applying shrinkage estimation. The assistant makes the following statements:
Statement 1
 Shr
inkage estimation of VCV matrices will decrease the effi-
ciency of the estimates versus the sample VCV matrix.
Statement 2
 Y
our proposed approach for estimating the VCV matrix will 
not be reliable because a sample VCV matrix is biased and 
inconsistent.
Statement 3
 A f
actor-based VCV matrix approach may result in some port -
folios that erroneously appear to be riskless if any asset returns can be completely determined by the common factors or some of the factors are redundant.
Bader then uses the Singer–Terhaar model and the final shrinkage-estimated 
VCV matrix to determine the equilibrium expected equity returns for all in-ternational asset classes by country. Three of the markets under consideration are located in Country A (developed market), Country B (emerging market), and Country C (emerging market). Bader projects that in relation to the global market, the equity market in Country A will remain highly integrated, the equity market in Country B will become more segmented, and the equity market in

Country C will become more fully integrated.
Next, Bader applies the Grinold–Kroner model to estimate the expected equi-
ty returns for the various markets under consideration. For Country A, Bader assumes a very long-term corporate earnings growth rate of 4% per year (equal to the expected nominal GDP growth rate), a 2% rate of net share repurchases for Country A’s equities, and an expansion rate for P/E multiples of 0.5% per year.
In reviewing Countries B and C, Bader’s research assistant comments that emerg-
ing markets are especially risky owing to issues related to politics, competition, and accounting standards. As an example, Bader and her assistant discuss the risk implications of the following information related to Country B:
 ■Experiencing declining per capita income
 ■Expected to continue its persistent current account deficit below 2% of GDP 
 ■Transitioning to International Financial Reporting Standards, with full con-
vergence scheduled to be completed within two years
Bader shifts her focus to currency expectations relative to clients’ base currency 
and summarizes her assumptions in Exhibit 1.

During a conversation about Exhibit 1, Bader and her research assistant dis-
cuss the composition of each country’s currency portfolio and the potential for triggering a crisis. Bader notes that some flows and holdings are more or less supportive of the currency, stating that investments in private equity make up the majority of Country A’s currency portfolio, investments in public equity make up the majority of Country B’s currency portfolio, and investments in public debt make up the majority of Country C’s currency portfolio.

3.
 B i
s correct. Statement 2 is correct because traded REIT securities are more high-
ly correlated with direct real estate and less highly correlated with equities over 
multi-year horizons. Thus, although REITs tend to act like stocks in the short run, they act like real estate in the longer run.
A and C are incorrect because Statement 1 is not correct. Traded REIT securities 
have relatively high correlations with equity securities over short time horizons, such as one year. The higher correlations suggest that traded REIT securities will not act as a good diversifier for an equity portfolio over a one-year period.
4.
 A i
s correct. An estimate of the long-run expected or required return for com-
mercial real estate equals the sum of the capitalization rate (cap rate) plus the growth rate (constant) of net operating income (NOI). An approximation of the steady-state NOI growth rate for commercial real estate is equal to the growth rate in GDP . Thus, from Equation 7 and the information provided in Exhibit 1, E(R
re) = Cap rate + NOI growth rate = 4.70% + 4.60% = 9.30%, which is approxi-
mately double the cap rate.
B is incorrect because the discount rate (expected or required return) equals the 
sum of the cap rate and the NOI growth rate. Based on the information in Exhibit 1, the 4.70% cap rate is less than (not greater than) the 9.30% discount rate.
C is incorrect because the discount rate over finite horizons (not long-run hori-
zons) needs to include the anticipated rate of change in the cap rate. For long-run expected return calculations, the anticipated rate of change in the cap rate is not included.

 C i
s correct. The in-house model assumes that the current observed return 
equals the weighted average of the current true return and the previous observed return. The model uses REIT index returns as proxies for the returns in the model. The smoothed nature of most published (observed) real estate returns is a major contributor to the appearance of low correlation with financial assets. This smoothing dampens the volatility of the observed data and distorts correlations with other assets. Thus, the raw observable data tend to understate the risk and

overstate the diversification benefits of these asset classes. It is generally accept-
ed that the true variance of real estate returns is greater than the variance of the observed data.
6.
 B i
s correct. If the investment horizon equals the (Macaulay) duration of the 
portfolio, the capital loss created by the increase in yields and the reinvestment effects (gains) will roughly offset, leaving the realized return approximately equal to the original yield to maturity. This relationship is exact if (a) the yield curve is flat and (b) the change in rates occurs immediately in a single step. In practice, the relationship is only an approximation. In the case of the domestic sovereign yield curve, the 20 bp increase in rates will likely be offset by the higher reinvest-ment rate, creating an annual return approximately equal to 2.00%.
7.
 A i
s correct. From the building block approach to fixed-income returns, the re-
quired return for fixed-income asset classes has four components: the one-period default-free rate, the term premium, the credit premium, and the liquidity premi-um. Since sovereign bonds are considered the highest-quality bonds, they likely do not have a significant credit premium nor are they likely to have a significant premium for illiquidity. The slope of the yield curve is useful information on which to base forecasts of the term premium. Therefore, the dominant source of the yield spread is most likely the term premium for XYZ’s sovereign bond.
8.
 A i
s correct. The credit premium is the additional expected return demanded 
for bearing the risk of default losses. A credit downgrade two steps lower will increase the credit premium and the required rate of return. The change in the default-free rate associated with the monetary tightening will increase (not decrease) the required rate of return. The widening of the spread between the sovereign bond and the next highest-quality government agency security indi-cates an increase in the liquidity premium, which will increase (not decrease) the required rate of return.
B is incorrect because the required rate of return would increase (not decrease) 
based on the change in the default-free rate associated with the monetary tightening.
C is incorrect because the rate of return would increase (not decrease) based on 
a change in the liquidity premium. The liquidity premium can be estimated from the yield spread between the highest-quality issuer (typically a sovereign bond) and the next highest-quality large issuer of similar bonds (often a government agency). A widening yield spread indicates an increase in the liquidity premium and required rate of return.
9.
 C i
s correct. Emerging market debt requires an analysis of economic and po-
litical/legal risks. Based on the macroeconomic factors, the risk of a bond investment in either Republic A or Republic B appears to be high. Thresholds such as the risk guidelines listed in the table below can be used to assess the attractiveness of the two emerging market (EM) opportunities in Republic A and Republic B. Most notably, both republics raise concern based solely on their fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratios greater than 4.00% (Republic A’s is 6.50% and Republic B’s is 8.20%).

 C i
s correct. An investment in the bonds of the international energy exploration 
and production company (Xdelp) looks attractive. The international market benefits from positive macroeconomic fundamentals: point in the business cycle, monetary and fiscal discipline, rising current account surplus, and an appreciat-ing currency. The anticipated credit rating improvement will add to the potential for this to become a profitable investment and enhance returns. An increase in the investments within the international fixed-income segment by 1.00% (existing weight is 6.17%) would take advantage of this opportunity and remain in compli-ance with the foundation’s 5.00%–10.00% strategic asset allocation limits.
A is incorrect because a decrease in the existing weight of real estate by 2.00% 
would put the portfolio weight below the minimum threshold of 2.00% (i.e., 3.34%  ̶  2.00% = 1.34%) of the foundation’s strategic asset allocation.
B is incorrect because the information presented in Exhibit 3 would lead the 
chief investment officer to avoid the two opportunities in emerging market debt (Emerging Republic A and Emerging Republic B) and not initiate a commitment to emerging market debt of 1.00% (i.e., increase the existing weight above 0.00%).
11.
 The st
atement correctly identifies economic, political and legal risk. The advis-
er has correctly identified some of the characteristics typically associated with emerging and frontier markets that may affect their governments’ and corporate borrowers’ ability and willingness to pay bondholders. However, the assertion that all emerging and frontier market fixed income securities pose such risk is incorrect, as many countries classified as “emerging” are considered to be healthy and prosperous economies.

 The hi
storical equity risk premium is 1.8%, calculated as follows:
 Historical 
equity returns − Historical 10-year government bond yield 
 = Historical equity risk premium
 4.6% 
− 2.8% = 1.8%
13.
 The Gr
inold–Kroner model states that the expected return on equity is the sum 
of the expected income return (2.4%), the expected nominal earnings growth return (7.3% = 2.3% from inflation + 5.0% from real earnings growth) and the expected repricing return (−3.45%). The expected change in market valuation of −3.45% is calculated as the percentage change in the P/E level from the current 14.5× to the expected level of 14.0×: (14 − 14.5)/14.5 = −3.45%. Thus, the expect-ed return is 2.4% + 7.3% − 3.45% = 6.25%.

 In addition t
o the economic, political and legal risks faced by fixed income inves-
tors, equity investors in emerging markets face corporate governance risks. Their ownership claims may be expropriated by corporate insiders, dominant share-holders or the government. Interested parties may misuse the companies’ assets. Weak disclosure and accounting standards may result in limited transparency that favors insiders. Weak checks and balances on governmental actions may bring about regulatory uncertainty, seizure of property or nationalization.
18.
 C i
s correct. Statement 3 is correct. As long as none of the factors used in a 
factor-based VCV model are redundant and none of the asset returns are com-pletely determined by the common factors, there will not be any portfolios that erroneously appear to be riskless. Therefore, a factor-based VCV matrix ap-proach may result in some portfolios that erroneously appear to be riskless if any asset returns can be completely determined by the common factors or some of the factors are redundant.
A is incorrect because shrinkage estimation of VCV matrices will increase the 
efficiency of the estimates versus the sample VCV matrix, because its mean squared error (MSE) will in general be smaller than the MSE of the (unbiased) sample VCV matrix. Efficiency in this context means a smaller MSE.
B is incorrect because, although the proposed approach is not reliable, the reason 
is not that the sample VCV matrix is biased and inconsistent; on the contrary, it is unbiased and consistent. Rather, the estimate of the VCV matrix is not reliable because the number of observations is not at least 10 times the number of assets (i.e., with 10 years of monthly return data, there are only 120 observations, but the rule of thumb suggests there should be at least 200 observations for 20 asset classes).

 B i
s correct. Bader expects the equity market in Country C (an emerging mar-
ket) to become more fully integrated with the global market while Country A (a developed market) remains highly integrated. All else being equal, the Singer–Terhaar model implies that when a market becomes more globally integrated (segmented), its required return should decline (rise). As prices adjust to a lower (higher) required return, the market should deliver an even higher (lower) return than was previously expected or required by the market. Therefore, the allocation to markets that are moving toward integration should be increased. If a market

is moving toward integration, its increased allocation will come at the expense of 
markets that are already highly integrated. This will typically entail a shift from developed markets to emerging markets.
20.
 B i
s correct. Country A’s long-term corporate earnings growth rate of 4% per year 
is equal to the expected nominal GDP growth rate of 4%, which is an economi-cally plausible long-run assumption. The only very long-run assumptions that are consistent with economically plausible relationships are %ΔE = Nominal GDP growth, %ΔS = 0, and %ΔP/E = 0, where %ΔE is the expected nominal earnings growth rate, %ΔS is the expected percentage change in shares outstanding, and %ΔP/E is the expected percentage change in the price-to-earnings ratio.
A is incorrect because a 2% rate of net share repurchases would eventually elim-
inate all shares, which is not an economically plausible very long-run assump-tion. The only very long-run assumptions that are consistent with economically plausible relationships are %ΔE = Nominal GDP growth, %ΔS = 0, and %ΔP/E = 0, where %ΔE is the expected nominal earnings growth rate, %ΔS is the expected percentage change in shares outstanding, and %ΔP/E is the expected percentage change in the price-to-earnings ratio.
C is incorrect because Country A’s perpetually rising P/E would lead to an 
arbitrarily high price per currency unit of earnings per share. The only very long-run assumptions that are consistent with economically plausible relation-ships are %ΔE = Nominal GDP growth, %ΔS = 0, %ΔP/E = 0, where %ΔE is the expected nominal earnings growth rate, %ΔS is the expected percentage change in shares outstanding, and %ΔP/E is the expected percentage change in the price-to-earnings ratio.
21.
 A i
s correct. Per capita income for Country B has been falling, which is a poten-
tial source of political stress.
B is incorrect because the persistent current account deficit has been below 2% 
of GDP . Persistent current account deficits greater than 4% of GDP probably indicate a lack of competitiveness.
C is incorrect because Country B has been transitioning to International Finan-
cial Reporting Standards, with full convergence expected within two years, which is a positive development for better accounting standards.
22.
 A i
s correct. Bader should reallocate capital from Country A, which is expected 
to have a secularly rising current account deficit, to Country C, which is expected to have a secularly rising current account surplus. A rising current account deficit will tend to put upward pressure on real required returns and downward pressure on asset prices, whereas a rising current account surplus (or narrowing deficit) will put downward pressure on real required returns and upward pressure on asset prices. Analysts should consider reallocation of portfolio assets from coun-tries with secularly rising current account deficits to those with secularly rising current account surpluses (or narrowing deficits).
23.
 A i
s correct. Purchasing power parity implies that the value of Country A’s cur-
rency will decline. Inflation for Country A is expected to rise relative to global inflation. Purchasing power parity implies that the expected percentage change in Country A’s exchange rate should be equal to the difference in expected inflation rates. If Country A’s inflation is rising relative to global inflation, then the curren-cy will be expected to depreciate.
B is incorrect because purchasing power parity implies that the value of Coun-
try B’s currency will remain stable. Inflation for Country B is expected to keep pace with global inflation. Purchasing power parity implies that the expected percentage change in Country B’s exchange rate should be equal to the difference in expected inflation rates. If Country B’s inflation is keeping pace with global

inflation, then the exchange rate will be expected to stay the same, corresponding 
to a stable value of Country B’s currency.
C is incorrect because purchasing power parity implies that the value of Country 
C’s currency will rise. Inflation for Country C is expected to fall relative to global inflation. Purchasing power parity implies that the expected percentage change in Country C’s exchange rate should be equal to the difference in expected inflation rates. If Country C’s inflation is falling relative to global inflation, then the cur-rency will be expected to appreciate.
24.
 B i
s correct. Hot money is flowing out of Country B; thus, Country B’s central 
bank is the most likely to sell foreign currency (thereby draining domestic liquid-ity) to limit/avoid depreciation of the domestic currency and buy government securities (thereby providing liquidity) to sterilize the impact on bank reserves and interest rates.
A is incorrect because Country A is not experiencing hot money flows and, 
therefore, would not need to sterilize the impact of money flows on domestic liquidity. 
C is incorrect because hot money is flowing into Country C; thus, Country C’s 
central bank is most likely to sell government securities to limit the growth of bank reserves and/or maintain a target level of interest rates.
25.
 C i
s correct. Public debt makes up the majority of Country C’s currency portfolio, 
which is the least supportive flow (or holding) to a currency. Public debt is less supportive because it has to be serviced and must be either repaid or refinanced, potentially triggering a crisis. Some types of flows and holdings are considered to be more or less supportive of the currency. Investments in private equity repre-sent long-term capital committed to the market and are most supportive of the currency. Public equity would likely be considered the next most supportive of the currency. Debt investments are the least supportive of the currency.
26.
 Pr
operties trade infrequently so there is no data on simultaneous periodic trans-
action prices for a selection of properties. Analysis therefore relies on appraisals. Secondly, each property is different, it is said to be heterogenous. The returns calculated from appraisals represent weighted averages of unobservable returns. Published return series is too smooth and the sample volatility understates the true volatility of returns. It also distorts estimates of correlations.
27.
 The e
xpected change in the cap rate from 5.7% to 5.5% represents a (5.5% − 
5.7%)/5.7% = 3.5% decrease.
Using the expression E(Rre) = CapRate + NOI growth rate − %ΔCapRate = 5.7% + 
(1% + 1.5%) − (−3.5%) = 11.7%. Note: As the cap rate is expected to decrease, property values are expected to 
increase, hence the cap rate change contributes to the expected return.
28.
 U
nder the first approach analysts focus on flows of export and imports to estab-
lish what the net trade flows are and how large they are relative to the economy and other, potentially larger financing and investment flows. The approach also considers differences between domestic and foreign inflation rates that relate to the concept of purchasing power parity. Under PPP , the expected percentage change in the exchange rate should equal the difference between inflation rates. The approach also considers the sustainability of current account imbalances, reflecting the difference between national saving and investment.
Under the second approach the analysis focuses on capital flows and the degree 
of capital mobility. It assumes that capital seeks the highest risk-adjusted return. The expected changes in the exchange rate will reflect the differences in the respective countries’ assets’ characteristics such as relative short-term interest

Asset owners are concerned with accumulating and maintaining the wealth needed to 
meet their needs and aspirations. In that endeavor, investment portfolios—including 
individuals’ portfolios and institutional funds—play important roles. Asset allocation 
is a strategic—and often a first or early—decision in portfolio construction. Because it 
holds that position, it is widely accepted as important and meriting careful attention. 
Among the questions addressed in this reading are the following:
 ■What is a sound governance context for making asset allocation decisions?
 ■How broad a picture should an adviser have of an asset owner’s assets and liabilities in recommending an asset allocation?
 ■How can an asset owner’s objectives and sensitivities to risk be represented in asset allocation?
 ■What are the broad approaches available in developing an asset allocation recommendation, and when might one approach be more or less appropri-ate than another?
 ■What are the top-level decisions that need to be made in implementing a chosen asset allocation?
 ■How may asset allocations be rebalanced as asset prices change?
The strategic asset allocation decision determines return levels1 in which alloca-
tions are invested, irrespective of the degree of active management. Because of its 
strategic importance, the investment committee, at the highest level of the governance 
hierarchy, typically retains approval of the strategic asset allocation decision. Often a proposal is developed only after a formal asset allocation study that incorporates 
obligations, objectives, and constraints; simulates possible investment outcomes over 
an agreed-on investment horizon; and evaluates the risk and return characteristics of 
the possible allocation strategies.
In providing an overview of asset allocation, this reading’s focus is the alignment 
of asset allocation with the asset owner’s investment objectives, constraints, and 
overall financial condition. This is the first reading in several sequences of readings 
that address, respectively, asset allocation and portfolio management of equities, fixed 
income, and alternative investments. Asset allocation is also linked to other facets of 
portfolio management, including risk management and behavioral finance. As coverage 
of asset allocation progresses in the sequence of readings, various connections to these 
topics, covered in detail in other areas of the curriculum, will be made.2
In the asset allocation sequence, the role of this reading is the “big picture. ” It also 
offers definitions that will provide a coordinated treatment of many later topics in portfolio management. The second reading provides the basic “how” of developing an asset allocation, and the third reading explores various common, real-world com-plexities in developing an asset allocation.
This reading is organized as follows: Section 1 explains the importance of asset 
allocation in investment management. Section 2 addresses the investment governance 
context in which asset allocation decisions are made. Section 3 considers asset allo-cation from the comprehensive perspective offered by the asset owner’s economic 
balance sheet. Sections 4 and 5 distinguish three broad approaches to asset allocation 
and explain how they differ in investment objective and risk. In Sections 6–9, these three approaches are discussed at a high level in relation to three cases. Section 10

The investment process shows a sequence of activities that begins with under -
standing the asset owner’s entire circumstance; objectives, including any constraints; 
and preferences. These factors, in conjunction with capital market inputs,3 form the 
basis for asset allocation as a first step in portfolio construction and give a structure 
within which other decisions—such as the decision to invest passively or actively—take 
place. In the flow chart, thick lines show initial flows (or relations of logic) and thin lines show feedback flows.
Asset allocation is widely considered to be the most important decision in the 
investment process. The strategic asset allocation decision completely determines 
return levels4 in which allocations are invested passively and also in the aggregate of 
all investors, irrespective of the degree of active management.
In providing an overview of asset allocation, this reading’s focus is the alignment of 
asset allocation with the asset owner’s investment objectives, constraints, and overall financial condition. The presentation begins with an introduction to the investment 
governance context of asset allocation. It then moves to present the economic balance 
sheet as the financial context for asset allocation itself.
INVESTMENT GOVERNANCE BACKGROUND
describe elements of effective investment governance and investment governance considerations in asset allocation
Investment governance represents the organization of decision-making responsibili-ties and oversight activities. Effective investment governance ensures that assets are invested to achieve the asset owner’s investment objectives within the asset owner’s risk tolerance and constraints, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regula-
tions. In addition, effective governance ensures that decisions are made by individuals 
or groups with the necessary skills and capacity.
Investment performance depends on asset allocation and  its implementation. Sound 
investment governance practices seek to align asset allocation and implementation to 
achieve the asset owner’s stated goals.
Investment governance structures are relevant to both institutional and individual 
investors. Because such structures are often formalized and articulated in detail for defined benefit pension plans, we will build our discussion using a pension plan gov -
ernance framework. Elements of pension plan governance that are not directly related 
to the management of plan assets—plan design, funding policy, and communications to participants—are not discussed in this reading. Instead, we focus on those aspects of governance that directly affect the asset allocation decision.
Governance Structures
Governance and management are two separate but related functions. Both are directed 
toward achieving the same end. But governance focuses on clarifying the mission, cre -
ating a plan, and reviewing progress toward achieving long- and short-term objectives,

Investment Governance Background 141
whereas management efforts are geared to outcomes—the execution of the plan to 
achieve the agreed-on goals and objectives. A common governance structure in an institutional investor context will have three levels within the governance hierarchy:
 ■governing investment committee
 ■investment staff
 ■third-party resources
The investment committee may be a committee of the board of directors, or the 
board of directors may have delegated its oversight responsibilities to an internal 
investment committee made up of staff. Investment staff may be large, with full 
in-house asset management capabilities, or small—for example, two to five investment 
staff responsible for overseeing external investment managers and consultants. It may 
even be part time—a treasurer or chief financial officer with many other, competing responsibilities. The term “third-party resources” is used to describe a range of pro-fessional resources—investment managers, investment consultants, custodians, and actuaries, for example.
Although there are many governance models in use, most effective models share 
six common elements. Effective governance models perform the following tasks:
1.
 Ar
ticulate the long- and short-term objectives of the investment program.
2.
 Allo
cate decision rights and responsibilities among the functional units in 
the governance hierarchy effectively, taking account of their knowledge, capacity, time, and position in the governance hierarchy.

 S

ment that will govern the day-to-day operations of the investment program.

stablish a reporting framework to monitor the program’s progress toward

6.
 P
eriodically undertake a governance audit.
In the sections that follow, we will discuss selected elements from this list.
Articulating Investment Objectives
Articulating long- and short-term objectives for an investor first requires an under -
standing of purpose—that is, what the investor is trying to achieve. Below are exam-ples of simple investment objective statements that can be clearly tied to purposes:
 ■Defined benefit pension fund. The investment objective of the fund is to ensure that plan assets are sufficient to meet current and future pension liabilities.
 ■Endowment fund. The investment objective of the endowment is to earn a rate of return in excess of the return required to fund, after accounting for inflation, ongoing distributions consistent with the endowment’s mission.
 ■Individual investor. The investment objective is to provide for retirement at the investor’s desired retirement age, family needs, and bequests, subject to stated risk tolerance and investment constraints.
A return requirement is often considered the essence of an investment objective 
statement, but for that portion of the objective statement to be properly understood requires additional context, including the obligations the assets are expected to fund, the nature of cash flows into and out of the fund, and the asset owner’s willingness

and ability to withstand interim changes in portfolio value. The ultimate goal is to find 
the best risk/return trade-off consistent with the asset owner’s resource constraints 
and risk tolerance.
As an example of how the overall context can affect decision making, the pension 
fund may be an active plan, with new participants added as they are hired, or it may be “frozen” (no additional benefits are being accrued by participants in the plan). The status of the plan, considered in conjunction with its funded ratio (the ratio of 
pension assets to pension liabilities), has a bearing on future contributions and benefit 
payments. The company offering the pension benefit may operate in a highly cyclical industry, where revenues ebb and flow over the course of the economic cycle. In this case, the plan sponsor may prefer a more conservative asset allocation to minimize the year-to-year fluctuations in its pension contribution.
The nature of inflows and outflows for an endowment fund can be quite different 
from those of a pension fund. An endowment fund may be used to support scholar -
ships, capital improvements, or university operating expenses. The fund sponsor has some degree of control over the outflows from the fund but very little control over the timing and amounts of contributions to the fund because the contributions are typically coming from external donors.
These cash inflow and outflow characteristics must be considered when establishing 
the goals and objectives of the fund.
A third, inter-related aspect of defining the sponsor’s goals and objectives is deter -
mining and communicating risk tolerance. There are multiple dimensions of risk to be considered: liquidity risk, volatility, risk of loss, and risk of abandoning a chosen course of action at the wrong time.
Effective investment governance requires consideration of the liquidity needs of 
the fund and the liquidity characteristics of the fund’s investments. For example, too large an allocation to relatively illiquid assets, such as real estate or private equity, might impair the ability to make payouts in times of market stress.
A high risk/high expected return asset allocation is likely to lead to wider swings 
in interim valuations. Any minimum thresholds for funded status that, if breached, would trigger an adverse event, such as higher pension insurance premiums, must be considered in the asset allocation decision.
For individual investors, the risk of substantial losses may be unacceptable for a 
variety of financial and psychological reasons. When such losses occur after retirement, 
lost capital cannot be replaced with future earnings.
Asset owners have their own unique return requirements and risk sensitivi -
ties. Managing an investment program without a clear understanding of long- and short-term objectives is similar to navigating without a map: Arriving at the correct destination on time and intact is not compatible with leaving much to chance.
Allocation of Rights and Responsibilities
The rights and responsibilities necessary to execute the investment program are gener -
ally determined at the highest level of investment governance. The allocation of those 
rights and responsibilities among the governance units is likely to vary depending on the size of the investment program; the knowledge, skills, and abilities of the internal staff; and the amount of time staff can devote to the investment program if they have other, competing responsibilities. Above all, good governance requires that decisions be delegated to those best qualified to make an informed decision. 
The resources available to an organization will affect the scope and complexity 
of the investment program and the allocation of rights and responsibilities. A small 
investment program may result in having a narrower opportunity set because of either 
asset size (too small to diversify across the range of asset classes and investment 
managers) or staffing constraints (insufficient asset size to justify a dedicated internal

staff). Complex strategies may be beyond the reach of entities that have chosen not 
to develop investment expertise internally or whose oversight committee lacks indi-viduals with sufficient investment understanding. Organizations willing to invest in attracting, developing, and retaining staff resources and in developing strong inter -
nal control processes, including risk management systems, are better able to adopt more complex investment programs. The largest investors, however, may find their size creates governance issues: Manager capacity constraints might lead to so many managers that it challenges the investor’s oversight capacity.
Allocation of rights and responsibilities across the governance hierarchy is a key 
element in the success of an investment program. Effective governance requires that the 
individuals charged with any given decision have the required knowledge and expertise 
to thoroughly evaluate the alternative courses of action and the capacity to take on the ongoing responsibility of those decisions, and they must be able to execute those 
decisions in a timely fashion. (Individual investors engaging a private wealth manager 
are delegating these expertise, capacity, and execution responsibilities.)

The available knowledge and expertise at each level of the hierarchy, the resource 
capacity of the decision makers, and the ability to act on a timely basis all influence the allocation of these rights and responsibilities.
Investment Policy Statement
The investment policy statement (IPS) is the foundation of an effective investment program. A well-crafted IPS can serve as a blueprint for ongoing fund management and assures stakeholders that program assets are managed with the appropriate care and diligence. 
Often, the IPS itself will be a foundation document that is revised slowly over 
time, whereas information relating to more variable aspects of the program—the 
asset allocation policy and guidelines for individual investment managers—will be contained in a more easily modified appendix.
Asset Allocation and Rebalancing Policy
Because of its strategic importance, the investment committee, at the highest level of the governance hierarchy, typically retains approval of the strategic asset allocation decision. A proposal is often developed only after a formal asset allocation study that incorporates obligations, objectives, and constraints; simulates possible investment outcomes over an agreed-on investment horizon; and evaluates the risk and return characteristics of the possible allocation strategies.
Governance considerations inform not only the overall strategic asset allocation 
decision but also rebalancing decisions. The IPS should contain at least general ori-enting information relevant to rebalancing. In an institutional setting, rebalancing policy might be the responsibility of the investment committee, organizational staff, 
or the external consultant. Likewise, individual investors might specify that they have 
delegated rebalancing authority to their investment adviser. Specification of rebalancing 
responsibilities is good governance.
Reporting Framework
The reporting framework in a well-run investment program should be designed in a 
manner that enables the overseers to evaluate quickly and clearly how well the invest -
ment program is progressing toward the agreed-on goals and objectives. The reporting 
should be clear and concise, accurately answering the following three questions:
 ■Where are we now?
 ■Where are we relative to the goals and objectives?
 ■What value has been added or subtracted by management decisions?
Key elements of a reporting framework should address performance evaluation, 
compliance with investment guidelines, and progress toward achieving the stated 
goals and objectives.
 ■Benchmarking is necessary for performance measurement, attribution, and evaluation. Effective benchmarking allows the investment committee to evaluate staff and external managers. Two separate levels of benchmarks are appropriate: one that measures the success of the investment managers rel-ative to the purpose for which they were hired and another to measure the gap between the policy portfolio and the portfolio as actually implemented.

Investment Governance Background 145
 ■Management reporting, typically prepared by staff with input from con-
sultants and custodians, provides responsible parties with the information necessary to understand which parts of the portfolio are performing ahead of or behind the plan and why, as well as whether assets are being managed in accordance with investment guidelines.
 ■Governance reporting, which addresses strengths and weaknesses in pro-gram execution, should be structured in such a way that regular commit -
tee meetings can efficiently address any concerns. Although a crisis might necessitate calling an extraordinary meeting, good governance structures minimize this need.
The Governance Audit
The purpose of the governance audit is to ensure that the established policies, pro-cedures, and governance structures are effective. The audit should be performed by an independent third party. The governance auditor examines the fund’s governing documents, assesses the capacity of the organization to execute effectively within the confines of those governing documents, and evaluates the existing portfolio for its “efficiency” given the governance constraints.
Effective investment governance ensures the durability or survivability of the invest -
ment program. An investment program must be able to survive unexpected market turmoil, and good investment governance makes certain that the consequences of 
such turmoil are considered before it is experienced. Good governance seeks to avoid 
decision-reversal risk—the risk of reversing a chosen course of action at exactly the wrong time, the point of maximum loss. Good investment governance also considers 
the effect of investment committee member and staff turnover on the durability of the 
investment program. Orientation sessions for new committee members and proper documentation of investment beliefs, policies, and decisions enhance the likelihood that the chosen course of action will be given sufficient time to succeed. New staff  or investment committee members should be able to perceive easily the design and intent of the investment program and be able to continue to execute it. Similarly, good investment governance prevents key person risk—overreliance on any one staff  member or long-term, illiquid investments dependent on a staff member. 
Good governance works to assure accountability. O’Barr and Conley (1992, p.21), 
who studied investment management organizations using anthropological techniques, 
found that blame avoidance (not accepting personal responsibility when appropriate to do so) is a common feature of institutional investors. Good governance works to prevent such behavior.
EXAMPLE 1
Investment Governance: Hypothetical Case 1
In January 2016, the Caflandia Office Workers Union Pension (COWUP) made the following announcement:
“COWUP will fully exit all hedge funds and funds of funds. Assets currently 
amounting to 15% of its investment program are involved. Although hedge funds 
are a viable strategy for some, when judged against their complexity and cost, 
hedge fund investment is no longer warranted for COWUP . ”
One week later, a financial news service reported the following:
“The COWUP decision on hedge funds was precipitated by an allegation of wrongdoing by a senior executive with hedge fund selection responsibilities in COWUP’s alternative investments strategy group. ”

1. Consider ing only the first statement, state what facts would be relevant in 
evaluating whether the decision to exit hedge funds was consistent with 
effective investment governance.
Solution:
The knowledge, capacity, and time available within COWUP to have an effective hedge fund investment program would need to be assessed against the stated concern for complexity and cost. The investment purpose served by hedge funds in COWUP’s investment program before it exited them needs to be analyzed.
2.
 Consider
ing both statements, identify deficiencies in COWUP’s investment 
governance.
Solution:
The second statement raises these concerns about the decision described in the first statement:
 ■Hiring and oversight of COWUP executives may have been inadequate.
 ■The initial COWUP information release was incomplete and possibly misleading. Public communications appear not to have received ade-quate oversight.
 ■Divesting hedge funds may be a reaction to the personnel issue rather than being based on investment considerations.

Investment Governance: Hypothetical Case 2
1. The imag inary country of Caflandia has a sovereign wealth fund with assets 
of CAF$40 billion. A governance audit includes the following:
“The professional chief investment officer (CIO) reports to a nine-member 
appointed investment committee board of directors headed by an executive 
director. Investment staff members draft asset allocation policy in conjunc -
tion with consultants and make recommendation to the investment commit -
tee; the investment committee reviews and approves policy and any changes 
in policy, including the strategic asset allocation. The investment committee 
makes manager structure, conducts manager analysis, and makes manager 
selection decisions. The CIO has built a staff organization, which includes heads for each major asset class. In examining decisions over the last five years, we have noted several instances in which political or non-economic considerations appear to have influenced the investment program, includ-ing the selection of local private equity investments. Generally, the board 
spends much of its time debating individual manager strategies for inclusion 
in the portfolio and in evaluating investment managers’ performance with comparatively little time devoted to asset allocation or risk management. ”
Based on this information and that in Exhibit 2, identify sound and ques-tionable governance practices in the management of the Caflandia sovereign wealth fund.

The Economic Balance Sheet and Asset Allocation 147
Solution:
Sound practices: The allocation of responsibilities for asset allocation 
between investment staff and the investment committee is sound prac-tice. Staff investment expertise should be reflected in the process of asset allocation policy and analysis. The investment committee assumes final responsibility for choices and decisions, which is appropriate given its posi-tion in receiving information from all parts of the organization and from all interested parties.
Questionable practices: The investment committee’s level of involvement in 
individual manager selection and evaluation is probably too deep. Exhibit 2 indicates that these functions more effectively reside with staff. Individual manager selection is an implementation and execution decision designed to achieve strategic decisions made by the investment committee and is typically not a strategic decision itself. Manager evaluation has substantial data analysis and technical elements that can be efficiently provided by staff experts and consultants. The finding about political/non-economic influ-ences indicates multiple problems. It confirms that the investment manager analysis and selection processes were misplaced. It also suggests that the investment committee has an inadequate set of governance principles or checks and balances as relates to the investment committee itself.
THE ECONOMIC BALANCE SHEET AND ASSET 
ALLOCATION
formulate an economic balance sheet for a client and interpret its implications for asset allocation
An accounting balance sheet reflects a point-in-time snapshot of an organization’s 
financial condition and shows the assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity recognized by 
accountants. An economic balance sheet  includes conventional assets and liabilities 
(called “financial assets” and “financial liabilities” in this reading) as well as additional 
assets and liabilities—known as extended portfolio assets and liabilities—that 
are relevant in making asset allocation decisions but do not appear on conventional balance sheets.
For individual investors, extended portfolio assets include human capital (the 
present value of future earnings), the present value of pension income, and the present 
value of expected inheritances. Likewise, the present value of future consumption is an extended portfolio liability.
For an institutional investor, extended portfolio assets might include underground 
mineral resources or the present value of future intellectual property royalties. Extended 
portfolio liabilities might include the present value of prospective payouts for foun-dations, whereas grants payable would appear as conventional liabilities.
Theory and, increasingly, practice suggest that asset allocation should consider the 
full range of assets and liabilities—both the financial portfolio and extended portfolio 
assets and liabilities—to arrive at an appropriate asset allocation choice. For example, 
an asset allocation process that considers the extended balance sheet, including the 3

sensitivity of an individual investor’s earnings to equity market risk (and that of the 
industry in which the individual is working), may result in a more appropriate allo-cation to equities than one that does not.
Life-cycle balanced funds (also known as target date funds) are examples of invest -
ments that seek to coordinate asset allocation with human capital. A 2040 life-cycle balanced fund that seeks to provide a retirement investment vehicle appropriate for many individuals retiring in 2040. Exhibit 3 illustrates a typical path for the compo-sition of an individual’s economic balance sheet from age 25 through age 65.

AgeFinancial CapitalHuman Capital
At age 25, with most of the individual’s working life ahead of him, human capital dominates the economic balance sheet. As the individual progresses through life, the 
present value of human capital declines as human capital is transformed into earnings. 
Earnings saved and invested build financial capital balances. By a retirement age of 65, the conversion of human capital to earnings and financial capital is assumed to be complete.
Life-cycle balanced funds reflect these extended portfolio assets. Research indi-
cates that, on average, human capital is roughly 30% equity-like and 70% bond-like, 
with significant variation among industries.5 Making the simplifying assumption that 
investors have approximately constant risk tolerance through life, their asset allocation 
for total overall wealth (including human capital and financial capital) should be, in 
theory, constant over time. In this case, the asset allocation chosen for financial capital 
should reflect an increasing allocation to bonds as human capital declines to age 65, 
holding all else constant. Exhibit 4 shows the glide path for the equity/bond allocation 
chosen by one US mutual fund family. The increasing allocation to bonds is consistent 
with the view that human capital has preponderant bond-like characteristics.

EXAMPLE 3
The Economic Balance Sheet of Auldberg University 
Endowment
 ■Name : Auldberg University Endowment (AUE)
 ■Narrative: AUE was established in 1852 in Caflandia and largely 
serves the tiny province of Auldberg. AUE supports about one-sixth of Auldberg University’s CAF$60 million operating budget; real estate income and provincial subsidies provide the remainder and have been relatively stable. The endowment has historically had a portfolio lim-ited to domestic equities, bonds, and real estate holdings; that policy is under current review. Auldberg University itself (not the endow -
ment) has a CAF$350 million investment in domestic commercial real estate assets, including office buildings and industrial parks, much of it near the campus. AUE employs a well-qualified staff with substantial diverse experience in equities, fixed income, and real estate.
 ■Assets: Endowment assets include CAF$100 million in domestic equi-ties, CAF$60 million in domestic government debt, and CAF$40 mil-lion in Class B office real estate. The present value of expected future contributions (from real estate and provincial subsidies) is estimated to be CAF$400 million.
 ■Liabilities: These include CAF$10 million in short-term borrowings and CAF$35 million in mortgage debt related to real estate invest -
ments. Although it has no specific legal requirement, AUE has a policy to distribute to the university 5% of 36-month moving average net assets. In effect, the endowment supports $10 million of Auldberg University’s annual operating budget. The present value of expected future support is CAF$450 million.
6 H uman capital is non-tradable, cannot be hedged, is subject to unspecified future taxes, and is a function 
of an individual’s mortality. Human capital is technically defined as the net present value of an investor’s future expected labor income weighted by the probability of surviving to each future age (see Ibbotson, Milevsky, Chen, and Zhu 2007). Thus, the present value of future earnings and pensions should be val-ued with mortality-weighted probabilities of receiving future cash flows, not the present value over life expectancy. There is meaningful extra value from the low-odds event of extreme longevity, which has an important portfolio implication in that individual investors can outlive their financial portfolios but not lifetime annuity payments.

2. D escribe elements in Auldberg University’s investments that might affect 
AUE’s asset allocation choices.
Solution:
AUE’s Class B real estate investments’ value and income are likely to be 
stressed during the same economic circumstances as the university’s own real estate investments. In such periods, the university may look to the en-dowment for increased operating support and AUE may not be well posi-tioned to meet that need. Thus, the AUE’s real estate investment is actually less diversifying than it may appear and the allocation to it may need to be re-examined. Similar considerations apply to AUE’s holdings in equities in relation to Auldberg University’s.

Approaches to Asset Allocation 151
We can identify three broad approaches to asset allocation: (1) asset-only, (2) 
liability-relative, and (3) goals-based. These are decision-making frameworks that 
take account of or emphasize different aspects of the investment problem.
Asset-only approaches to asset allocation focus solely on the asset side of the 
investor’s balance sheet. Liabilities are not explicitly modeled. Mean–variance opti-mization (MVO) is the most familiar and deeply studied asset-only approach. MVO considers only the expected returns, risks, and correlations of the asset classes in the opportunity set. In contrast, liability-relative and goals-based approaches explicitly account for the liabilities side of the economic balance sheet, dedicating assets to 
meet, respectively, legal liabilities and quasi-liabilities (other needs that are not strictly 
liabilities but are treated as such) or goals.
Liability-relative approaches to asset allocation choose an asset allocation in rela-
tion to the objective of funding liabilities. The phrase “funding of liabilities” means to provide for the money to pay liabilities when they come due. An example is surplus optimization: mean–variance optimization applied to surplus (defined as the value of the investor’s assets minus the present value of the investor’s liabilities). In model-ing, liabilities might be represented by a short position in a bond or series of bonds 
matched to the present value and duration of the liabilities. Another approach involves 
constructing a liability-hedging portfolio focused on funding liabilities and, for any remaining balance of assets, a risky-asset portfolio (so called because it is risky or riskier in relation to liabilities—often also called a “return-seeking portfolio” because it explicitly seeks return above and beyond the liability benchmark). Liability-driven 
investing (LDI) is an investment industry term that generally encompasses asset 
allocation that is focused on funding an investor’s liabilities. Related fixed-income 
techniques are covered in the fixed-income sequence under liability-based mandates.
All approaches to asset allocation can be said to address goals. In investment 
practice and literature, however, the term “goals based” has come be widely associated 
with a particular type of approach to asset allocation and investing.
Goals-based approaches to asset allocation, as discussed here, are used primarily 
for individuals and families, involve specifying asset allocations for sub-portfolios, each of which is aligned to specified goals ranging from supporting lifestyle needs to aspirational. Each goal is associated with regular, irregular, or bulleted cash flows; a distinct time horizon; and a risk tolerance level expressed as a required probability of achieving the goal.
7 For example, a middle-aged individual might specify a goal of 
maintaining his current lifestyle and require a high level of confidence that this goal will 
be attained. That same individual might express a goal of leaving a bequest to his alma 
mater. This would be a very long-term goal and might have a low required probability. 
Each goal is assigned to its own sub-portfolio, and an asset allocation strategy specific 
to that sub-portfolio is derived. The sum of all sub-portfolio asset allocations results in an overall strategic asset allocation for the total portfolio. Goals-based investing  
(GBI) is an investment industry term that encompasses the asset allocation focused on addressing an investor’s goals.
INSTITUTIONS AND GOALS-BASED ASSET ALLOCATION
Asset segmentation as practiced by some life insurers has some similarities 
to goals-based investing. Asset segmentation involves notionally or actually 
segmenting general account assets into sub-portfolios associated with specific lines of business or blocks of liabilities. On one hand, such an approach may be 
distinguished from goals-based asset allocation for individual investors in being 
motivated by competitive concerns (to facilitate offering competitive crediting rates on groups of contracts) rather than behavioral ones. On the other hand,

Learning Module 3  O verview of Asset Allocation 152
Fraser and Jennings (2006) described a behaviorally motivated goals-based 
approach to asset allocation for foundations and endowments. Following their 
approach, components of an overall appropriate mean–variance optimal port -
folio are allocated to time-based sub-portfolios such that uncomfortably novel or risky positions for the entity’s governing body are made acceptable by being placed in longer-term sub-portfolios.
Although any asset allocation approach that considers the liabilities side of the 
economic balance sheet might be termed “liability relative, ” there are several important 
distinctions between liabilities for an institutional investor and goals for an individual 
investor. These distinctions have meaningful implications for asset allocation:8
 ■Liabilities of institutional investors are legal obligations or debts, whereas goals, such as meeting lifestyle or aspirational objectives, are not. Failing to meet them does not trigger similar consequences.
 ■Whereas institutional liabilities, such as life insurer obligations or pension benefit obligations, are uniform in nature (all of a single type), an individu-al’s goals may be many and varied.
 ■Liabilities of institutional investors of a given type (e.g., the pension ben-efits owed to retirees) are often numerous and so, through averaging, may often be forecast with confidence. In contrast, individual goals are not subject to the law of large numbers and averaging. Contrast an estimate of expected death benefits payable for a group of life insurance policies against an individual’s uncertainty about the resources needed in retirement: For a 65-year-old individual, the number of remaining years of life is very uncer -
tain, but insurers can estimate the average for a group of 65-year-olds with some precision.
LIABILITY-RELATIVE AND GOALS-BASED APPROACHES TO INVESTING
Various perspectives exist concerning the relationship between liability-relative 
and goals-based approaches to investing. Professor Lionel Martellini summarizes 
one perspective in the following three statements:9
1. G oals-based investing is related to a new paradigm that advocates 
more granular and investor-centric investment solutions.
2.
 Thi
s new investment solutions paradigm translates into goals-based 
investing (GBI) approaches in individual money management, in which investors’ problems can be summarized in terms of their goals, and it translates into liability-driven investing (LDI) approaches in institutional money management, where the investors’ liability is treated as a proxy for their goal.
3.
 GBI and L
DI are therefore related, but each of these approaches has 
its own specific characteristics. For example, GBI implies the capacity to help individual investors identify a hierarchical list of goals, with a distinction between different types of goals (affordable versus non affordable, essential versus aspirational, etc.) for which no exact coun-terpart exists in institutional money management.

Approaches to Asset Allocation 153
Relevant Objectives
All three of the asset allocation approaches listed here seek to make optimal use 
of the amount of risk that the asset owner is comfortable bearing to achieve stated 
investment objectives, although they generally define risk differently. Exhibit 5 sum-marizes typical objectives.

In a mean–variance asset-only approach, the objective is to maximize expected port -
folio return per unit of portfolio volatility over some time horizon, consistent with 
the investor’s tolerance for risk and consistent with any constraints stated in the IPS. A portfolio’s Sharpe ratio is a characteristic metric for evaluating portfolios in an asset-only mean–variance approach.
The basic objective of a liability-relative asset allocation approach is to ensure 
payment of liabilities when they are due.
A goals-based approach is similar to a liability-relative approach in that it also seeks 
to ensure that there are sufficient assets to meet the desired payouts. In goals-based approaches, however, goals are generally associated with individual sub-portfolios, 
and an asset allocation is designed for each sub-portfolio that reflects the time horizon 
and required probability of success such that the sum of the sub-portfolios addresses the totality of goals satisfactorily.
Relevant Risk Concepts
Asset-only approaches focus on asset class risk and effective combinations of asset 
classes. The baseline asset-only approach, mean–variance optimization, uses volatility 
(standard deviation) of portfolio return as a primary measure of risk, which is a func -
tion of component asset class volatilities and the correlations of asset class returns. A 
mean–variance asset allocation can also incorporate other risk sensitivities, including 
risk relative to benchmarks and downside risk. Risk relative to benchmarks is usually 
measured by tracking risk (tracking error). Downside risk can be represented in various 
ways, including semi-variance, peak-to-trough maximum drawdown, and measures that focus on the extreme (tail) segment of the downside, such as value at risk.

Learning Module 3  O verview of Asset Allocation 154
Mean–variance results, although often the starting point for understanding portfo -
lio risk, are regularly augmented by Monte Carlo simulation. By providing information 
about how an asset allocation performs when one or more variables are changed—for 
example, to values representing conditions of financial market stress—simulation helps 
complete the picture of risk, including downside and tail risk. Insights from simulation 
can then be incorporated as refinements to the asset allocation.
Liability-relative approaches focus on the risk of having insufficient assets to pay 
obligations when due, which is a kind of shortfall risk. Other risk concerns include the 
volatility of contributions needed to fund liabilities. Risk in a liability-relative context 
is generally underpinned by the differences between asset and liability characteristics 
(e.g., their relative size, their interest rate sensitivity, their sensitivity to inflation).
Goals-based approaches are concerned with the risk of failing to achieve goals.10 
The risk limits can be quantified as the maximum acceptable probability of not 
achieving a goal.11 The plural in “liabilities” and “goals” underscores that these risks 
are generally related to multiple future points in time. Overall portfolio risk is thus 
the weighted sum of the risks associated with each goal.
Generally, a given statistical risk measure may be relevant in any of the three 
approaches. For example, standard deviation can be used to assess overall portfolio 
volatility in asset-only approaches, and it may be used to measure surplus volatility (the 
volatility of the difference between the values of assets and liabilities) or the volatility of the funded ratio (the ratio of the values of assets and liabilities) in liability-relative asset allocation.

Asset classes are one of the most widely used investment concepts but are often inter -
preted in distinct ways. Greer (1997) defines an asset class as “a set of assets that bear some fundamental economic similarities to each other, and that have characteristics that make them distinct from other assets that are not part of that class. ” He specifies three “super classes” of assets:
 ■Capital assets. An ongoing source of something of value (such as interest or dividends); capital assets can be valued by net present value.
 ■Consumable/transformable assets. Assets, such as commodities, that can be consumed or transformed, as part of the production process, into something else of economic value, but which do not yield an ongoing stream of value.
 ■Store of value assets. Neither income generating nor valuable as a consum-able or an economic input; examples include currencies and art, whose economic value is realized through sale or exchange.

EXAMPLE 4
Asset Classes (1)
Classify the following investments based on Greer’s (1997) framework, or explain 
how they do not fit in the framework:
1.
 Pr
ecious metals
Precious metals are a store of value asset except in certain industrial 
applications (e.g., palladium and platinum in the manufacture of catalytic converters).
2.
 
Petroleum
Petroleum is a consumable/transformable asset; it can be consumed to gen-
erate power or provide fuel for transport.
3.
 H
edge funds
Hedge funds do not fit into Greer’s (1997) super class framework; a hedge fund strategy invests in underlying asset classes.
4.
 
Timberland
Timberland is a capital asset or consumable/transformable asset. It is a capi-
tal asset in the sense that timber can be harvested and replanted cyclically to generate a stream of cash flows; it is a consumable asset in that timber can be used to produce building materials/ packaging or paper.
5.
 Infl
ation-linked fixed-income securities
Inflation-linked fixed-income securities is a capital asset because cash flows can be determined based on the characteristics of the security.
6.
 
Volatility
Volatility does not fit; it is a measurable investment characteristic. Because 
equity volatility is the underlying for various derivative contracts and an investable risk premium may be associated with it, it is mentioned by some as an asset.
Greer (1997) approaches the classification of asset classes in an abstract or generic 
sense. The next question is how to specify asset classes to support the purposes of strategic asset allocation.
12 For example, if a manager lumps together very different 
investments, such as distressed credit and Treasury securities, into an asset class called 
“fixed income, ” asset allocation becomes less effective in diversifying and controlling risk. Furthermore, the investor needs a logical framework for distinguishing an asset class from an investment strategy. The following are five criteria that will help in effectively specifying asset classes for the purpose of asset allocation:
13
1. A ssets within an asset class should be relatively homogeneous. Assets within 
an asset class should have similar attributes. In the example just given, defining equities to include both real estate and common stock would result in a non-homogeneous asset class.

2. A sset classes should be mutually exclusive. Overlapping asset classes will 
reduce the effectiveness of strategic asset allocation in controlling risk and 
could introduce problems in developing asset class return expectations. For example, if one asset class for a US investor is domestic common equities, then world equities ex-US is more appropriate as another asset class rather than global equities, which include US equities.
3.
 A
sset classes should be diversifying. For risk control purposes, an included 
asset class should not have extremely high expected correlations with other asset classes or with a linear combination of other asset classes. Otherwise, the included asset class will be effectively redundant in a portfolio because it will duplicate risk exposures already present. In general, a pairwise correla-tion above 0.95 is undesirable (given a sufficient number of observations to have confidence in the correlation estimate).
4.
 The a
sset classes as a group should make up a preponderance of world invest-
able wealth. From the perspective of portfolio theory, selecting an asset allo-cation from a group of asset classes satisfying this criterion should tend to increase expected return for a given level of risk. Furthermore, the inclusion of more markets expands the opportunities for applying active investment strategies, assuming the decision to invest actively has been made. However, such factors as regulatory restrictions on investments and government-im-posed limitations on investment by foreigners may limit the asset classes an investor can invest in.
5.
 A
sset classes selected for investment should have the capacity to absorb a 
meaningful proportion of an investor’s portfolio. Liquidity and transaction costs are both significant considerations. If liquidity and expected transac -
tion costs for an investment of a size meaningful for an investor are unfavor -
able, an asset class may not be practically suitable for investment.
Note that Criteria 1 through 3 strictly focus on assets themselves, while Criterion 5, and to some extent Criterion 4, involve potential investor-specific considerations.
ASSET CLASSES SHOULD BE DIVERSIFYING
Pairwise asset class correlations are often useful information and are readily obtained. However, in evaluating an investment’s value as a diversifier at the portfolio level, it is important to consider an asset in relation to all other assets as a group rather than in a one-by-one (pairwise) fashion. It is possible to reach limited or incorrect conclusions by solely considering pairwise correlations. To give an example, denote the returns to three assets by X , Y, and Z , respectively. 
Suppose that Z = aX + bY; a and b are constants, not both equal to zero. Asset 
Z is an exact weighted combination of X  and Y  and so has no value as a diver -
sifier added to a portfolio consisting of assets X  and Y . Yet, if the correlation 
between X and Y  is −0.5, it can be shown that Z  has a correlation of just 0.5 
with X as well as with Y .
Examining return series’ correlations during times of financial market stress 
can provide practically valuable insight into potential diversification benefits beyond typical correlations that average all market conditions.
In current professional practice, the listing of asset classes often includes the 
following:
 ■Global public equity—composed of developed, emerging, and sometimes frontier markets and large-, mid-, and small-cap asset classes; sometimes treated as several sub-asset classes (e.g., domestic and non-domestic).

Modeling Asset Class Risk 157
 ■Global private equity—includes venture capital, growth capital, and lev -
eraged buyouts (investment in special situations and distressed securities 
often occurs within private equity structures too).
 ■Global fixed income—composed of developed and emerging market debt and further divided into sovereign, investment-grade, and high-yield sub-asset classes, and sometimes inflation-linked bonds (unless included in real assets; see the following bullet). Cash and short-duration securities can be included here.
 ■Real assets—includes assets that provide sensitivity to inflation, such as pri-vate real estate equity, private infrastructure, and commodities. Sometimes, global inflation-linked bonds are included as a real asset rather than fixed income because of their sensitivity to inflation.
EMERGING MARKET EQUITIES AND FIXED INCOME
Investment practice distinguishes between developed and emerging market 
equities and fixed income within global equities. The distinction is based on 
practical differences in investment characteristics, which can be related to typical 
market differences including the following:
 ■diversification potential, which is related to the degree to which investment factors driving market returns in developed and emerging markets are not identical (a topic known as “market integration”);
 ■perceived level of informational efficiency; and
 ■corporate governance, regulation, taxation, and currency convertibility.
As of mid-2016, emerging markets represent approximately 10% of world 
equity value based on MSCI indices.14 In fixed income, investment opportunities 
have expanded as governments and corporations domiciled in emerging markets 
have increasingly issued debt in their own currency. Markets in local currency 
inflation-indexed emerging market sovereign debt have become more common.15
“ Asset classes” are, by definition, groupings of assets. Investment vehicles, such 
as hedge funds, that apply strategies to asset classes and/or individual investments with the objective of earning a return to investment skill or providing attractive risk characteristics may be treated as a category called “strategies” or “diversifying strate-
gies. ” When that is the case, this category is assigned a percentage allocation of assets, 
similar to a true asset class. Economically, asset classes contrast with “strategies” by offering, in general, an inherent, non-skill-based ex ante expected return premium.
16
Effective portfolio optimization and construction may be hindered by excessive 
asset class granularity. Consider Exhibit 6.
14 M SCI uses three broad definitions to sort countries into developed, emerging, and frontier: 1) economic 
development, 2) size and liquidity requirements, and 3) market accessibility criteria (see the MSCI Market Classification Framework at www

As more and more sub-asset classes are defined, they become less distinctive. In par -
ticular, the sources of risk for more broadly defined asset classes are generally better 
distinguished than those for narrowly defined subgroups. For example, the overlap in 
the sources of risk of US large-cap equity and US small-cap equity would be greater 
than the overlap between US and non-US equity. Using broadly defined asset classes with fewer risk source overlaps in optimization is consistent with achieving a diver -
sified portfolio. Additionally, historical data for broadly defined asset classes may 
be more readily available or more reliable. The question of how much to allocate to 
equity versus fixed income versus other assets is far more important in strategic asset 
allocation than precisely how much to allocate to the various sub-classes of equity and 
fixed income. However, when the investor moves from the strategic asset allocation phase to policy implementation, sub-asset class choices become relevant.
EXAMPLE 5
Asset Classes (2)
1. Di scuss a specification of asset classes that distinguishes between “domes-
tic intermediate-duration fixed income” and “domestic long-duration fixed income. ” Contrast potential relevance in asset-only and liability-relative contexts.
Solution:
These two groups share key risk factors, such as interest rate and credit risk. For achieving diversification in asset risk—for example, in an asset-only context—asset allocation using domestic fixed income, which includes in-termediate and long duration, should be effective and simple. Subsequently, allocation within domestic fixed income could address other considerations, such as interest rate views. When investing in relation to liabilities, distinc-tions by duration could be of first-order importance and the specification could be relevant.
Any asset allocation, by whatever means arrived at, is expressed ultimately in terms 
of money allocations to assets. Traditionally—and still in common practice—asset 
allocation uses asset classes as the unit of analysis. Thus, mean–variance optimization 
based on four asset classes (e.g., global public equity, global private equity, global fixed 
income, and real assets) would be based on expected return, return volatility, and return

correlation estimates for these asset classes. (The development of such capital market 
assumptions is the subject of another reading.) Factor-based approaches, discussed 
in more detail later, do not use asset classes as the basis for portfolio construction. Technically, the set of achievable investment outcomes cannot be enlarged simply by developing an asset allocation by a different means (for instance, using asset classes as the unit of analysis), all else being equal, such as constraints against short selling 
(non-negativity constraints).17 Put another way, adopting a factor-based asset allocation 
approach does not, by default, lead to superior investment outcomes.
There are allocation methods that focus on assigning investments to the investor’s 
desired exposures to specified risk factors. These methods are premised on the obser -
vation that asset classes often exhibit some overlaps in sources of risk, as illustrated in Exhibit 7.

The overlaps seen in Exhibit 7 help explain the correlation of equity and credit assets. 
Modeling using asset classes as the unit of analysis tends to obscure the portfolio’s 
sensitivity to overlapping risk factors, such as inflation risk in this example. As a result, 
controlling risk exposures may be problematic. Multifactor risk models, which have a history of use in individual asset selection, have been brought to bear on the issue of controlling systematic risk exposures in asset allocation.
In broad terms, when using factors as the units of analysis, we begin with specifying 
risk factors and the desired exposure to each factor. Asset classes can be described with respect to their sensitivities to each of the factors. Factors, however, are not 
directly investable. On that basis, asset class portfolios that isolate exposure to the risk 
factor are constructed; these factor portfolios involve both long and short positions. 
A choice of risk exposures in factor space can be mapped back to asset class space for 
implementation. Uses of multifactor risk models in asset allocation have been labeled 
“factor-based asset allocation” in contrast to “asset class-based asset allocation, ” which 
uses asset classes directly as the unit of analysis.
FACTOR REPRESENTATION
Although risk factors can be thought of as the basic building blocks of invest -
ments, most are not directly investable. In this context, risk factors are associated 
with expected return premiums. Long and short positions in assets (spread

positions) may be needed to isolate the respective risks and associated expected 
return premiums. Other risk factors may be accessed through derivatives. The 
following are a few examples of how risk factor exposures can be achieved.
 ■Inflation. Going long nominal Treasuries and short inflation-linked bonds isolates the inflation component.
 ■Real interest rates. Inflation-linked bonds provide a proxy for real interest rates.
 ■US volatility. VIX (Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index) futures provide a proxy for implied volatility.
 ■Credit spread. Going long high-quality credit and short Treasuries/government bonds isolates credit exposure.
 ■Duration. Going long 10+ year Treasuries and short 1–3 year Treasuries isolates the duration exposure being targeted.
FACTOR MODELS IN ASSET ALLOCATION
The interest in using factors for asset allocation stems from a number of con-siderations, including the following:
 ■The desire to shape the asset allocation based on goals and objectives that cannot be expressed by asset classes (such as matching liability characteristics in a liability-relative approach).
 ■An intense focus on portfolio risk in all of its various dimensions, helped along by availability of commercial factor-based risk measure-ment and management tools.
 ■The acknowledgment that many highly correlated so-called asset classes are better defined as parts of the same high-level asset class. For example, domestic and foreign equity may be better seen as sub-classes of global public equity.
 ■The realization that equity risk can be the dominant risk exposure even in a seemingly well-diversified portfolio.
STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION
recommend and justify an asset allocation based on an investor’s objectives and constraints
An asset allocation that arises in long-term investment planning is often called the 
“strategic asset allocation” or “policy portfolio”: It is an asset allocation that is expected 
to be effective in achieving an asset owner’s investment objectives, given his or her investment constraints and risk tolerance, as documented in the investment policy statement.6

Strategic Asset Allocation 161
A theoretical underpinning for quantitative approaches to asset allocation is utility 
theory, which uses a utility function as a mathematical representation of preferences 
that incorporates the investor’s risk aversion. According to utility theory, the optimal 
asset allocation is the one that is expected to provide the highest utility to the investor 
at the investor’s investment time horizon. The optimization program, in broad terms, is
     Maximize
   by choice  of asset  class  weights   w  i     E [U ( W  T  ) ]  = f ⎛
 ⎜ 
⎝  W  0   ,   w  i   ,

degree  of risk aversion  ⎞
 ⎟ 
⎠ 
        
subject  to ∑ 
i=1  n
   w  i   = 1  and  any  other  constraints  on    w  i     
The first line i
s the objective function, and the second line consists of constraints on 
asset class weights; other constraints besides those on weights can also be incorporated 
(for example, specified levels of bond duration or portfolio yield may be targeted). 
With W0 and WT (the values of wealth today and at time horizon T , respectively) the 
investor’s problem is to select the asset allocation that maximizes the expected utility 
of ending wealth, E[ U(WT)], subject to the constraints that asset class weights sum to 
1 and that weights observe any limits the investor places on them. Beginning wealth, asset class weights, and asset class returns imply a distribution of values for ending wealth, and the utility function assigns a value to each of them; by weighting these values by their probability of occurrence, an expected utility for the asset allocation is determined.
An expected utility framework underlies many, but not all, quantitative approaches 
to asset allocation. A widely used group in asset allocation consists of power utility 
functions,19 which exhibit the analytically convenient characteristic that risk aversion 
does not depend on the level of wealth. Power utility can be approximated by mean–variance utility, which underlies mean–variance optimization.
OPTIMAL CHOICE IN THE SIMPLEST CASE
The simplest asset allocation decision problem involves one risky asset and one risk-free asset. Let λ, μ, r
f, and σ2 represent, respectively, the investor’s degree 
of risk aversion, the risk asset’s expected return, the risk-free interest rate, and 
the variance of return. With mean–variance utility, the optimal allocation to the 
risky asset, w *, can be shown to equal
  w* =   1 _ λ      (    μ −  r  f   _  σ   2    )     
The allo
cation to the risky asset is inversely proportional to the investor’s risk 
aversion and directly proportional to the risk asset’s expected return per unit 
of risk (represented by return variance).20
19 P ower utility has the form 
  U =    w  T  1−λ  _ 1 − λ   , 
where λ > 0 is the parameter of risk aversion (if λ→ 0, the investor is risk neutral).

Selection of a strategic asset allocation generally involves the following steps:21

meant for (e.g., paying future benefit payments, contributing to a university’s

terate back to Step 7 until an appropriate and agreed-on asset allocation is 
constructed.
Subsequent readings on asset allocation in practice will address the “how. ” The 
following sections give an indication of thematic considerations. We use investors with 
specific characteristics to illustrate the several approaches distinguished: sovereign wealth fund for asset-only allocation; a frozen corporate DB plan for liability-relative 
allocation; and an ultra-high-net-worth family for goals-based allocation. In practice, 
any type of investor could approach asset allocation with varying degrees of focus on modeling and integrating liabilities-side balance sheet considerations. How these 
cases are analyzed in this reading should not be viewed as specifying normative limits 
of application for various asset allocation approaches. For example, a liability-relative 
perspective has wide potential relevance for institutional investors because it has the potential to incorporate all information on the economic balance sheet. Investment advisers to high-net-worth investors may choose to use any of the approaches.

Strategic Asset Allocation: Asset Only 163
STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION: ASSET ONLY
recommend and justify an asset allocation based on an investor’s 
objectives and constraints
describe the use of the global market portfolio as a baseline portfolio in asset allocation
Asset-only allocation is based on the principle of selecting portfolios that make effi-cient use of asset risk. The focus here is mean–variance optimization, the mainstay 
among such approaches. Given a set of asset classes and assumptions concerning their 
expected returns, volatilities, and correlations, this approach traces out an efficient frontier that consists of portfolios that are expected to offer the greatest return at 
each level of portfolio return volatility. The Sharpe ratio is a key descriptor of an asset 
allocation: If a portfolio is efficient, it has the highest Sharpe ratio among portfolios with the same volatility of return.
An example of an investor that might use an asset-only approach is the (hypothet -
ical) Government Petroleum Fund of Caflandia (GPFC) introduced next.
INVESTOR CASE FACTS: GPFC, A SOVEREIGN WEAL TH FUND
 ■Name : Government Petroleum Fund of Caflandia (GPFC)
 ■Narrative: The imaginary emerging country of Caflandia has estab-lished a sovereign wealth fund to capture revenue from its abundant petroleum reserves. The government’s goal in setting up the fund is to promote a fair sharing of the benefits between current and future generations (intergenerational equity) from the export of the country’s petroleum resources. Caflandia’s equity market represents 0.50% of global equity market capitalization. Economists estimate that distribu-tions in the interest of intergenerational equity may need to begin in 20 years. Future distribution policy is undetermined.
 ■Tax status: Non-taxable.
 ■Financial assets and financial liabilities: Financial assets are CAF$40 billion at market value, making GPFC among the largest investors in Caflandia. GPFC has no borrowings.
 ■Extended assets and liabilities: Cash inflows from petroleum exports are assumed to grow at inflation + 1% for the next 15 years and may change depending on reserves and global commodity demand. The present value of expected future income from state-owned reserves is estimated to be CAF$60 billion. Future spending needs are positively correlated with consumer inflation and population growth. In Exhibit 8, the amount for the present value (PV) of future spending, which GPFC has not yet determined, is merely a placeholder to balance assets and liabilities; as a result, no equity is shown.7

For GPFC, the amount and timing of funds needed for future distributions to 
Caflandia citizens are, as yet, unclear. GPFC can currently focus on asset risk and its 
efficient use to grow assets within the limits of the fund’s risk tolerance. In addition 
to considering expected return in relation to volatility in selecting an asset allocation, 
GPFC might include such considerations as the following:
 ■diversification across global asset classes (possibly quantified as a constraint on the proportion allocated to any given asset classes);
 ■correlations with the petroleum sources of income to GPFC;
 ■the potential positive correlation of future spending with inflation and pop-ulation growth in Caflandia;
 ■long investment horizon (as a long-term investor, GPFC may be well posi-tioned to earn any return premium that may be associated with the rela-tively illiquid asset classes); and
 ■return outcomes in severe financial market downturns.
Suppose GPFC quantifies its risk tolerance in traditional mean–variance terms 
as willingness to bear portfolio volatility of up to 17% per year. This risk tolerance is partly based on GPFC’s unwillingness to allow the fund to fall below 90% funded. 
GPFC’s current strategic asset allocation, along with several alternatives that have been 
developed by its staff during an asset allocation review, are shown in Exhibit 9. The category “Diversifying strategies” consists of a diversified allocation to hedge funds.

Notes: The government bond rate is 3%. The acceptable level of volatility is ≤ 17% per year. The value at 
risk (VaR) is stated as a percent of the initial portfolio value over one year (e.g., −16% means a decline of 16%).
GPFC decides it is willing to tolerate a 5% chance of losing 22% or more of portfolio value in a given year. This risk is evaluated by examining the one-year 5% VaR of potential asset allocations.
Let us examine GPFC’s decision. The current asset allocation and the alternatives 
developed by staff all satisfy the GPFC’s tolerance for volatility and VaR limit. The staff’s alternatives appear to represent incremental, rather than large-scale, changes from the current strategic asset allocation. We do not know whether capital market assumptions have changed since the current strategic asset allocation was approved.
Mix A, compared with the current asset allocation, diversifies the equity alloca-
tion to include non-domestic (global ex-domestic) equities and spreads the current allocation to real estate over real estate and diversifying strategies. Given GPFC’s long investment horizon and absence of liquidity needs, an allocation to diversifying strategies at 10% should not present liquidity concerns. Because diversifying strate-gies are more liquid than private real estate, the overall liquidity profile of the fund improves. It is important to note that given the illiquid nature of real estate, it could take considerable time to reallocate from real estate to diversifying strategies. Mix A has a lower volatility (by 133 bps) than the current allocation and slightly lower tail 
22 The a ssumed expected returns and return volatilities are (given in that order in parentheses and expressed 
as decimals, rather than percentages): domestic equities (0.11, 0.25), non-domestic equities (0.09, 0.18), nominal bonds (0.05, 0.10), inflation-linked bonds (0.035, 0.06), real estate (0.075, 0.16), and diversifying 
strategies (0.07, 0.09). A correlation matrix with hypothetical values and a hypothetical relationship between 
the allocations and VaR also lies behind the exhibit. Because the purpose here is to illustrate concepts rather 
than mechanics, inputs are not discussed although they are very important in asset allocation.

risk (the 5% VaR for Mix A is −15%, whereas the 5% VaR for the current asset mix is 
−17%). Mix A’s Sharpe ratio is slightly higher. On the basis of the facts given, Mix A appears to be an incremental improvement on the current asset allocation.
Compared with Mix A and the current asset allocation, Mix B increases the 
allocation to equities by 15 percentage points and pulls back from the allocation to bonds and, in relation to Mix A, diversifying strategies. Although Mix B has a higher expected return and its VaR is within GPFC’s tolerance of 22%, Mix B’s lower Sharpe 
ratio indicates that it makes inefficient use of its additional risk. Mix B does not appear 
to deserve additional consideration.
Compared with the current asset allocation and Mix A, Mix C’s total allocation to 
equities, at 55%, is higher and the mix is more diversified considering the allocation of 
25% non-domestic equities. Mix C’s allocation to fixed income is 20% compared with 30% for Mix A and the current asset mix. The remaining fixed-income allocation has been diversified with an exposure to both nominal and inflation-linked bonds. The diversifying strategies allocation is funded by a combination of the reduced weights to fixed income and real estate. The following observations may be made:
 ■Mix C’s increase in equity exposure (compared with the equity exposure of Mix A and the current mix) has merit because more equity-like choices in the asset allocation could be expected to give GPFC more exposure to such a factor as a GDP growth factor (see Exhibit 9); population growth is one driver of GDP .
 ■Within fixed income, Mix C’s allocation to inflation-linked bonds could be expected to hedge the inflation risk inherent in future distributions.
 ■Mix C has the lowest volatility and the lowest VaR among the asset alloca-tions, although the differences compared with Mix A are very small. Mix C’s Sharpe ratio is comparable to (insignificantly higher than) Mix A’s.
Based on the facts given, Mix A and Mix C appear to be improvements over 
the current mix. Mix C may have the edge over Mix A based on the discussion. As a further step in the evaluation process, GPFC may examine the robustness of the 
forecasted results by changing the capital market assumptions and simulating shocks 
to such variables as inflation. The discussion of Mix C shows that there are means for potential liability concerns (the probable sensitivity of spending to inflation and population growth) to enter decision making even from a mean–variance optimiza-tion perspective.
EXAMPLE 6
Asset-Only Asset Allocation
1. D escribe how the Sharpe ratio, considered in isolation, would rank the asset 
allocation in Exhibit 9.
Solution:
The ranking by Sharpe ratios in isolation is C (3.70), A (3.69), and current and B (both 3.53). Using only the Sharpe ratio, Mix C appears superi-or to the other choices, but such an approach ignores several important considerations.

Strategic Asset Allocation: Asset Only 167
2. S tate a limitation of basing a decision only on the Sharpe ratio addressed in 
Question 1.
Solution:
The Sharpe ratio, while providing a means to rank choices on the basis of 
return per unit of volatility, does not capture other characteristics that are likely to be important to the asset owner, such as VaR and funded ratio. Fur-thermore, the Sharpe ratio by itself cannot confirm that the absolute level of portfolio risk is within the investor’s specified range.
3.
 An a
ssertion is heard in an investment committee discussion that because 
the Sharpe ratio of diversifying strategies (0.55) is higher than real estate’s (0.50), any potential allocation to real estate would be better used in diversi-fying strategies. Describe why the argument is incomplete.
Solution:
It is true that the higher the Sharpe ratio of an investment, the greater its contribution to the Sharpe ratio of the overall portfolio, holding all other things equal. However, that condition is not usually true. Diversification potential in a portfolio (quantified by correlations) may differ. For example, including both diversifying strategies and real estate in an allocation may ultimately decrease portfolio-level risk through favorable correlation char-acteristics. Also, as in the solution to Question 2, other risk considerations besides volatility may be relevant.
Financial theory suggests that investors should consider the global market-value 
weighted portfolio as a baseline asset allocation. This portfolio, which sums all invest -
able assets (global stocks, bonds, real estate, and so forth) held by investors, reflects the balancing of supply and demand across world markets. In financial theory, it is the portfolio that minimizes diversifiable risk, which in principle is uncompensated. 
Because of that characteristic, theory indicates that the global market portfolio should 
be the available portfolio that makes the most efficient use of the risk budget.23 Other 
arguments for using it as a baseline include its position as a reference point for a highly diversified portfolio and the discipline it provides in relation to mitigating any investment biases, such as home-country bias (discussed below).
At a minimum, the global market portfolio serves as a starting point for discussion 
and ensures that the investor articulates a clear justification for moving away from global capitalization market weights. The global market portfolio is expressed in two phases. The first phase allocates assets in proportion to the global portfolio of stocks, 
bonds, and real assets. The second phase disaggregates each of these broad asset 
classes into regional, country, and security weights using capitalization weights. The second phase is typically used within a global equity portfolio where an asset owner will examine the global capitalization market weights and either accept them or alter 
them. Common tilts (biases) include overweighting the home-country market, value, 
size (small cap), and emerging markets. For many investors, allocations to foreign fixed income have been adopted more slowly than allocations to foreign equity. Most investors have at least some amount in non-home-country equity.
23 A ccording to the two-fund separation theorem, all investors optimally hold a combination of a risk-free 
asset and an optimal portfolio of all risky assets. This optimal portfolio is the global market value portfolio.

HOME-COUNTRY BIAS
A given for GPFC was that Caflandia’s equity markets represent only 0.50% of 
the value of world equity markets. However, in all asset allocations in Exhibit 9, the share of domestic equity ranged from 50% for the current asset allocation to 30% for Mix C. The favouring of domestic over non-domestic investment 
relative to global market value weights is called home-country bias and is 
very common. Even relatively small economies feature pension plans, endow -
ments, and other funds, which are disproportionately tilted toward the equity and fixed-income offerings in the domestic market. The same tendency is true for very large markets, such as the United States and the eurozone. By biasing toward the home market, asset owners may not be optimally aligning regional 
weights with the global market portfolio and are implicitly implementing a market 
view. Investment explanations for the bias, such as offsetting liabilities that are denominated in the home currency, may be relevant in some cases, however.
For reference, the MSCI All Country World Portfolio (ACWI), a proxy for 
the public equities portion of the global equity market portfolio, contains the following capitalization weights as of 31 December 2015:
 ■Developed Europe and the Middle East: 22.8%
 ■Developed Pacific: 11.7%
 ■North America: 55.9%
 ■Emerging markets: 9.6%
Investing in a global market portfolio faces several implementation hurdles. First, 
estimating the size of each asset class on a global basis is an imprecise exercise given 
the uneven availability of information on non-publicly traded assets. Second, the prac -
ticality of investing proportionately in residential real estate, much of which is held in 
individual homeowners’ hands, has been questioned. Third, private commercial real estate and global private equity assets are not easily carved into pieces of a size that is accessible to most investors. Practically, proxies for the global market portfolio are 
often based only on traded assets, such as portfolios of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 
Furthermore, some investors have implemented alternative weighting schemes, such as GDP weight or equal weight. However, it is a useful discipline to articulate a jus -
tification for any deviation from the capitalization-weighted global market portfolio.
STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION: LIABILITY RELATIVE
recommend and justify an asset allocation based on an investor’s objectives and constraints
To illustrate the liability-relative approach, we take the defined benefit (DB) pension plan of (hypothetical) GPLE Corporation, with case facts given below.
A FROZEN DB PLAN, GPLE CORPORATION PENSION
 ■Name : GPLE Corporation Pension8

Strategic Asset Allocation: Liability Relative 169
 ■Narrative: GPLE is a machine tool manufacturer with a market 
value of $2 billion. GPLE is the sponsor of a $1.25 billion legacy DB plan, which is now frozen (i.e., no new plan participants and no new benefits accruing for existing plan participants). GPLE Pension has a funded ratio (the ratio of pension assets to liabilities) of 1.15. Thus, the plan is slightly overfunded. Responsibility for the plan’s management rests with the firm’s treasury department (which also has responsibility for GPLE Corporation treasury operations).
 ■Tax status: Non-taxable.
 ■Financial assets and financial liabilities: Assets amount to $1.25 billion at market values. Given a funded ratio of 1.15, that amount implies that liabilities are valued at about $1.087 billion. Projected distributions to pension beneficiaries have a present value of $1.087 billion at market value.
GPLE does not reflect any extended assets or liabilities; thus, economic net worth is identical to traditional accounting net worth.

GPLE, the plan sponsor, receives two asset allocation recommendations. 
Recommendation A does not explicitly consider GPLE’s pension’s liabilities but is 
instead based on an asset-only perspective: the mean–variance efficient frontier given 
a set of capital market assumptions. A second recommendation, “Recommendation 
B, ” does explicitly consider liabilities, incorporating a liability-hedging portfolio based 
on an analysis of GPLE pension liabilities and a return-seeking portfolio.
In evaluating asset allocation choices, consider the pensioners’ and the plan spon -
sor’s interests. Pensioners want to receive the stream of promised benefits with as little 
risk, or chance of interruption, as possible. Risk increases as the funded ratio declines. 
When the funded ratio is 1.0, pension assets just cover pension liabilities with no safety 
buffer. When the funded ratio is less than 1.0, the plan sponsor generally needs to make up the deficit in pension assets by contributions to the plan. For example, with a 10-year investment time horizon and a choice between two asset allocations, the allocation with the lower expected present value of cumulative contributions to Year 10 would generally be preferred by the sponsor, all else being equal. In practice, all else is usually not equal. For example, the alternative with the lower expected present value of contributions may involve more risk to the level of contributions in adverse market conditions. For example, the 5% of worst outcomes for the present value of

Learning Module 3  O verview of Asset Allocation 170
cumulative contributions may be more severe for the lower expected contribution 
alternative. Thus, possible asset allocations generally involve risk trade-offs.24 Now 
consider the recommendations.
Recommendation A, based on asset-only analysis, involves a 65% allocation to 
global equities and a 35% allocation to global fixed income. Assume that this asset 
allocation is mean–variance efficient and has the highest Sharpe ratio among portfolios 
that meet the pension’s assumed tolerance for asset return volatility. Capital market assumptions indicate that equities have a significantly higher expected return and volatility than fixed income.
Recommendation B, based on a liability-relative approach to asset allocation, 
involves an allocation of $1.125 billion to a fixed-income portfolio that is very closely matched in interest rate sensitivity to the present value of plan liabilities (and to any other liability factor risk exposures)—the liability hedging portfolio—and a $0.125 
allocation to equities (the return-seeking portfolio). This is a proportional allocation of 
10% to equities and 90% to fixed income. The equities allocation is believed to provide 
potential for increasing the size of the buffer between pension assets and liabilities with 
negligible risk to funded status. Recommendation B lies below the asset-only efficient 
frontier with a considerably lower expected return vis-à-vis Recommendation A.
What are the arguments for and against each of these recommendations? 
Recommendation A is expected, given capital market assumptions, to increase the size of the buffer between pension assets and liabilities. But the sponsor does not benefit from increases in the buffer if the current buffer is adequate.
25 However, with 
a 0.65 × $1.25 billion = $0.8125 allocation to equities and a current buffer of assets of $1.25 billion – $1.087 billion = $0.163 billion, a decline of that amount or more in equity values (a 20% decline) would put the plan into underfunded status (assuming no commensurate changes in the liability). Thus, Recommendation A creates contri-bution risk for the plan sponsor without a potential upside clearly benefiting either the sponsor or beneficiaries.
For Recommendation B, because the risk characteristics of the $1.125 billion 
fixed-income portfolio are closely matched with those of the $1.087 billion of pen-sion liabilities with a buffer, the plan sponsor should not face any meaningful risk of needing to make further contributions to the pension. Pensioners expect the plan to be fully funded on an ongoing basis without any reliance on the sponsor’s ability to make additional contributions. This is an excellent outcome for both. The pension liabilities are covered (defeased). 
The example is highly stylized—the case facts were developed to make points 
cleanly—but does point to the potential value of managing risk in asset allocation 
explicitly in relation to liabilities. A typical use of fixed-income assets in liability-relative 
asset allocation should be noted: Liability-relative approaches to asset allocation 
tend to give fixed income a larger role than asset-only approaches in such cases as the one examined here because interest rates are a major financial market driver of both liability and bond values. Thus, bonds can be important in hedging liabilities, but equities can be relevant for liability hedging too. With richer case facts, as when liabilities accrue with inflation (not the case in the frozen DB example), equities may have a long-term role in matching the characteristics of liabilities. In underfunded plans, the potential upside of equities would often have greater value for the plan sponsor than in the fully funded case examined.
24 Collie and G annon (2009) explore the contribution risk trade-off considered here in more detail.

Strategic Asset Allocation: Goals Based 171
LIABILITY GLIDE PATHS
If GPLE were underfunded, it might consider establishing a liability glide path. A 
liability glide path is a technique in which the plan sponsor specifies in advance 
the desired proportion of liability-hedging assets and return-seeking assets and 
the duration of the liability hedge as funded status changes and contributions 
are made. The technique is particularly relevant to underfunded pensions. The idea reflects the fact that the optimal asset allocation in general is sensitive to changes in the funded status of the plan. The objective is to increase the funded status by reducing surplus risk over time. Although a higher contribution rate may be necessary to align assets with liabilities, the volatility of contributions should decrease, providing more certainty for cash flow planning purposes and decreasing risk to plan participants. Eventually, GPLE would hope to achieve and maintain a sufficiently high funded ratio so that there would be minimal 
risk of requiring additional contributions or transferring pension risk to an 
annuity provider.
The importance of such characteristics as interest rate sensitivity (duration), infla -
tion, and credit risk in constructing a liability-hedging asset portfolio suggests the 
relevance of risk-factor modeling in liability-relative approaches. A risk factor approach 
can be extended to the return-seeking portfolio in order to minimize unintentional 
overlap among common factors across both portfolios—for example, credit. Exploring 
these topics is outside the scope of the current reading.
The next section addresses an approach to asset allocation related to liability 
relative in its focus on funding needs.
STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION: GOALS BASED
recommend and justify an asset allocation based on an investor’s objectives and constraints
We use the hypothetical Lee family to present some thematic elements of a goals-based 
approach.
INVESTOR CASE FACTS: THE LEE FAMILY
 ■Name : Ivy and Charles Lee
 ■Narrative: Ivy is a 54-year-old life sciences entrepreneur. Charles is 55 years old and employed as an orthopedic surgeon. They have two unmarried children aged 25 (Deborah) and 18 (David). Deborah has a daughter with physical limitations.
 ■Financial assets and financial liabilities: Portfolio of SGD 25 million with SGD 1 million in margin debt as well as residential real estate of SGD 3 million with $1 million in mortgage debt.
 ■Other assets and liabilities:
 ●Pre-retirement earnings are expected to total SGD 16 million in present value terms (human capital).9

 ●David will soon begin studying at a four-year private university; 
the present value of the expected parental contribution is SGD 250,000.
 ●The Lees desire to give a gift to a local art museum in five years. In present value terms, the gift is valued at SGD 750,000.
 ●The Lees want to establish a trust for their granddaughter with a present value of SGD 3 million to be funded at the death of Charles.
 ●The present value of future consumption expenditures is estimated at SGD 20 million.

The financial liabilities shown are legal liabilities. The extended liabilities include 
funding needs that the Lees want to meet. The balance sheet includes an esti-
mate of the present value of future consumption, which is sometimes called the 
“consumption liability. ” The amount shown reflects expected values over their life 
expectancy given their ages. If they live longer, consumption needs will exceed 
the SGD 20 million in the case facts and erode the SGD 18 million in equity. If their life span is shorter, SGD 18 million plus whatever they do not consume of the SGD 20 million in PV of future consumption becomes part of their estate. Note that for the Lees, the value of assets exceeds the value of liabilities, result -
ing in a positive economic net worth (a positive difference between economic assets and economic liabilities); this is analogous to a positive owners’ equity on a company’s financial balance sheet.
From Exhibit 11, we can identify four goals totaling SGD 24 million in present 
value terms: a lifestyle goal (assessed as a need for SGD 20 million in present value terms), an education goal (SGD 0.25 million), a charitable goal (SGD 0.75 million), and the special needs trust (SGD 3 million).
The present value of expected future earnings (human capital) at SGD 16 
million is less than the lifestyle present value of SGD 20 million, which means 
that some part of the investment portfolio must fund the Lees’ standard of 
living. It is important to note that although the Lee family has SGD 18 million

Strategic Asset Allocation: Goals Based 173
of economic net worth, most of this comes from the SGD 16 million extended 
asset of human capital. Specific investment portfolio assets have not yet been dedicated to specific goals.
Goals-based asset allocation builds on several insights from behavioral finance. The 
approach’s characteristic use of sub-portfolios is grounded in the behavioral finance 
insight that investors tend to ignore money’s fungibility26 and assign specific dollars to 
specific uses—a phenomenon known as mental accounting. Goals-based asset alloca -
tion, as described here, systemizes the fruitful use of mental accounts. This approach may help investors embrace more-optimal portfolios (as defined in an asset-only or asset–liability framework) by adding higher risk assets—that, without context, might frighten the investor—to longer-term, aspirational sub-portfolios while adopting a more conservative allocation for sub-portfolios that address lifestyle preservation.
In Exhibit 11, the Lees’ lifestyle goal is split into three components: a component 
called “lifestyle—minimum” intended to provide protection for the Lees’ lifestyle in a disaster scenario, a component called “lifestyle—baseline” to address needs out -
side of worst cases, and a component called “lifestyle—aspirational” that reflects a desire for a chance at a markedly higher lifestyle. These sum to the present value of future consumption shown in the preceding Exhibit 11. Exhibit 12 describes these qualitatively; a numerical characterization could be very relevant for some advisers, 
however. By eliciting information on the Lees’ perception of the goals’ importance, the 
investment adviser might calibrate the required probabilities of achieving the goals quantitatively. For example, the three lifestyle goals might have 99%, 90%, and 50% assigned probabilities of success, respectively.
Exhibit 12: Lee Family: Required Probability of Meeting Goals and Goal Time Horizons
GoalRequired Probability of 
Achieving Time Horizon
Lifestyle—minimum Extremely high Short to distant
Lifestyle—baseline Very high Short to distant
Lifestyle—aspirational Moderate Distant
Education Very high Short
Trust High Long
Charitable Moderate Short
Because the Lees might delay or forego making a gift to the museum if it would affect 
the trust goal, the trust goal is more urgent for the Lees. Also note that although parts 
of the Lees’ lifestyle goals run the full time horizon spectrum from short to distant, they also have significant current earnings and human capital (which transforms into earnings as time passes). This fact puts the investment portfolio’s role in funding the lifestyle goal further into the future.
Goals-based approaches generally set the strategic asset allocation in a bottom-up 
fashion. The Lees’ lifestyle goal might be addressed with three sub-portfolios, with the longest horizon sub-portfolio being less liquid and accepting more risk than the 
26 “F ungibility” is the property of an asset that a quantity of it may be replaced by another equal quantity in the satisfaction of an obligation. Thus, any 5,000 Japanese yen note can be used to pay a yen obligation of that amount, and the notes can be said to be fungible.

others. Although for the GPLE pension, no risk distinction was made among different 
parts of the pension liability vis-à-vis asset allocation, such distinctions are made in 
goals-based asset allocation.
What about the Lees’ other goals? Separate sub-portfolios could be assigned to 
the special needs and charitable goals with asset allocations that reflect the associated 
time horizons and required probabilities of not attaining these goals. A later reading on asset allocation in practice addresses implementation processes in detail.
TYPES OF GOALS
As goals-based asset allocation has advanced, various classification systems for goals have been proposed. Two of those classification systems are as follows.
Brunel (2012):
 ■Personal goals—to meet current lifestyle requirements and unantici-
pated financial needs
 ■Dynastic goals—to meet descendants’ needs
 ■Philanthropic goals
Chhabra (2005):
 ■Personal risk bucket—to provide protection from a dramatic decrease in lifestyle (i.e., safe-haven investments)
 ■Market risk bucket—to ensure the current lifestyle can be maintained (allocations for average risk-adjusted market returns)
 ■Aspirational risk bucket—to increase wealth substantially (greater than average risk is accepted)

2. Wha t goal(s) may be addressed by Allocation B?
Solution:
Allocation B has a greater growth emphasis, although it is somewhat con-
servative in relation to a 70/30 equity/bond baseline. It may be appropriate for funding the trust because of the goal’s long time horizon and the Lees’ desire for a high probability of achieving it.
3.
 Wha
t insights does goals-based asset allocation offer on this opportunity?
Solution:
Early-stage venture capital investments are both risky and illiquid; there-fore, they belong in the longer-term and more risk-tolerant sub-portfolios. Ivy’s decision about how much money she can commit should relate to how much excess capital remains after addressing goals that have a higher prior-ity associated with them. Note that economic balance sheet thinking would stress that the life sciences opportunity is not particularly diversifying to her human capital.
DISCOUNT RATES AND LONGEVITY RISK
Although calculation of assets needed for sub-portfolios is outside the scope of this reading, certain themes can be indicated. Consider a retiree with a life expectancy of 20 years. The retiree has two goals:
 ■To maintain his current lifestyle upon retirement. This goal has a high required probability of achievement that is evaluated at 95%.
 ■To gift $1 million to a university in five years. This is viewed as a “desire” rather than a “need” and has a required probability evaluated at 75%.
Suppose that the investor’s adviser specifies sub-portfolios as follows:
 ■for the first decade of lifestyle spending, a 3% expected return;
 ■for the second decade of lifestyle spending, a 4.6% expected return; and
 ■for the planned gift to the university, a 5.4% expected return.
Based on an estimate of annual consumption needs and the amount of the 
gift and given expected returns for the assigned sub-portfolios, the assets to be assigned to each sub-portfolio could be calculated by discounting amounts back to the present using their expected returns. However, this approach does 
not reflect the asset owner’s required probability of achieving a goal. The higher 
the probability requirement for a future cash need, the greater the amount of assets needed in relation to it. Because of the inverse relation between present value and the discount rate, to reflect a 95% required probability, for example, the discount rates could be set at a lower level so that more assets are assigned 
to the sub-portfolio, increasing the probability of achieving the goal to the 
required level of 95% level.
Another consideration in determining the amount needed for future con-
sumption is longevity risk. Life expectancies are median (50th percentile) out -
comes. The retiree may outlive his life expectancy. To address longevity risk, the 
calculation of the present value of liabilities might use a longer life expectancy, such as a 35-year life expectancy instead of his actuarial 20-year expectation.

Learning Module 3  O verview of Asset Allocation 176
Another approach is to transfer the risk to an insurer by purchasing an annuity 
that begins in 20 years and makes payments to the retiree for as long as he lives. 
Longevity risk and this kind of deferred annuity (sometimes called a “longevity 
annuity”) are discussed in another curriculum reading on risk management.27
There are some drawbacks to the goals-based approach to asset allocation. One 
is that the sub-portfolios add complexity. Another is that goals may be ambiguous or may change over time. Goals-based approaches to asset allocation raise the question of how sub-portfolios coordinate to constitute an efficient whole. The subject will be 
taken up in a later reading, but the general finding is that the amount of sub-optimality 
is small.28
IMPLEMENTATION CHOICES
discuss strategic implementation choices in asset allocation, including passive/active choices and vehicles for implementing passive and active mandates
Having established the strategic asset allocation policy, the asset owner must address additional strategic considerations before moving to implementation. One of these is the passive/active choice.
There are two dimensions of passive/active choices. One dimension relates to the 
management of the strategic asset allocation itself—for example, whether to deviate from it tactically or not. The second dimension relates to passive and active imple-mentation choices in investing the allocation to a given asset class. Each of these are covered in the sections that follow.
In an advisory role, asset managers have an unequivocal responsibility to make 
implementation and asset selection choices that are initially, and on an ongoing basis, 
suitable for the client.29
Passive/Active Management of Asset Class Weights
Tactical asset allocation (TAA) involves deliberate short-term deviations from the 
strategic asset allocation. Whereas the strategic asset allocation incorporates an inves -
tor’s long-term, equilibrium market expectations, tactical asset allocation involves short-term tilts away from the strategic asset mix that reflect short-term views—for example, to exploit perceived deviations from equilibrium.
Tactical asset allocation is active management at the asset class level because 
it involves intentional deviations from the strategic asset mix to exploit perceived 
opportunities in capital markets to improve the portfolio’s risk–return trade-off. TAA 
mandates are often specified to keep deviations from the strategic asset allocation within 
rebalancing ranges or within risk budgets. Tactical asset allocation decisions might be responsive to price momentum, perceived asset class valuation, or the particular 
stage of the business cycle. A strategy incorporating deviations from the strategic asset 
allocation that are motivated by longer-term valuation signals or economic views is sometimes distinguished as dynamic asset allocation (DAA).

Implementation Choices 177
Tactical asset allocation may be limited to tactical changes in domestic stock–bond 
or stock–bond–cash allocations or may be a more comprehensive multi-asset approach, 
as in a global tactical asset allocation (GTAA) model. Tactical asset allocation inherently 
involves market timing as it involves buying and selling in anticipation of short-term 
changes in market direction; however, TAA usually involves smaller allocation tilts than an invested-or-not-invested market timing strategy.
Tactical asset allocation is a source of risk when calibrated against the strategic 
asset mix. An informed approach to tactical asset allocation recognizes the trade-off 
of any potential outperformance against this tracking error. Key barriers to successful 
tactical asset allocation are monitoring and trading costs. For some investors, higher short-term capital gains taxes will prove a significant obstacle because taxes are an 
additional trading cost. A program of tactical asset allocation must be evaluated 
through a cost–benefit lens. The relevant cost comparisons include the expected 
costs of simply following a rebalancing policy (without deliberate tactical deviations).
Passive/Active Management of Allocations to Asset Classes
In addition to active and passive decisions about the asset class mix, there are active and passive decisions about how to implement the individual allocations within asset 
classes. An allocation can be managed passively or actively or incorporate both active 
and passive sub-allocations. For investors who delegate asset management to external 
firms, these decisions would come under the heading of manager structure,30 which 
includes decisions about how capital and active risk are allocated to points on the passive/active spectrum and to individual external managers selected to manage the investor’s assets.
31
With a passive management approach, portfolio composition does not react to 
changes in the investor’s capital market expectations or to information on or insights into individual investments. (The word passive means not reacting.) For example, a portfolio constructed to track the returns of an index of European equities might add 
or drop a holding in response to a change in the index composition but not in response 
to changes in the manager’s expectations concerning the security’s investment value; the market’s expectations reflected in market values and index weights are taken as is. Indexing is a common passive approach to investing. (Another example would be buying and holding a fixed portfolio of bonds to maturity.)
In contrast, a portfolio manager for an active management strategy will respond to 
changing capital market expectations or to investment insights resulting in changes to 
portfolio composition. The objective of active management is to achieve, after expenses, 
positive excess risk-adjusted returns relative to a passive benchmark.
The range of implementation choices can be practically viewed as falling along 
a passive/active spectrum because some strategies use both passive and active ele-
ments. In financial theory, the pure model of a passive approach is indexing to a broad 
market-cap-weighted index of risky assets—in particular, the global market portfolio. 
This portfolio sums all investments in index components and is macro-consistent in the sense that all investors could hold it, and it is furthermore self-rebalancing to the extent it is based on market-value-weighted indices. A buy-and-hold investment as a proxy for the global market portfolio would represent a theoretical endpoint on the passive/active spectrum. However, consider an investor who indexes an equity allocation to a broad-based value equity style index. The investment could be said to reflect an active decision in tilting an allocation toward value but be passive in implementation because it involves indexing. An even more active approach would

be investing the equity allocation with managers who have a value investing approach 
and attempt to enhance returns through security selection. Those managers would 
show positive tracking risk relative to the value index in general. Unconstrained active 
investment would be one that is “go anywhere” or not managed with consideration of 
any traditional asset class benchmark (i.e., “benchmark agnostic”). The degree of active 
management has traditionally been quantified by tracking risk and, from a different 
perspective, by active share.
Indexing is generally the lowest-cost approach to investing. Indexing involves some 
level of transaction costs because, as securities move in and out of the index, the port -
folio holdings must adjust to remain in alignment with the index. Although indexing to a market-cap-weighted index is self-rebalancing, tracking an index based on other weighting schemes requires ongoing transactions to ensure the portfolio remains in alignment with index weights. An example is tracking an equally weighted index: As changes in market prices affect the relative weights of securities in the portfolio over time, the portfolio will need to be rebalanced to restore equal weights. Portfolios 
tracking fixed-income indices also incur ongoing transaction costs as holdings mature, 
default, or are called away by their issuers.
Exhibit 13 diagrams the passive/active choice as a continuum rather than binary 
(0 or 1) characteristic. Tracking risk and active share are widely known quantitative 
measures of the degree of active management that capture different aspects of it. Each 
measure is shown as tending to increase from left to right on the spectrum; however, they do not increase (or decrease) in lockstep with each other, in general.

Asset class allocations may be managed with different approaches on the spectrum. For 
example, developed market equities might be implemented purely passively, whereas 
emerging market bonds might be invested with an unconstrained, index-agnostic 
approach.
Factors that influence asset owners’ decisions on where to invest on the passive/
active spectrum include the following:
 ■Available investments. For example, the availability of an investable and representative index as the basis for indexing.
 ■Scalability of active strategies being considered. The prospective value added by an active strategy may begin to decline at some level of invested assets. In addition, participation in it may not be available below some asset level, a consideration for small investors.
 ■The feasibility of investing passively while incorporating client-specific con-straints. For example, an investor’s particular ESG investing criteria may not align with existing index products.
 ■Beliefs concerning market informational efficiency. A strong belief in market efficiency for the asset class(es) under consideration would orient the inves-tor away from active management.

Implementation Choices 179
 ■The trade-off of expected incremental benefits relative to incremental costs 
and risks of active choices. Costs of active management include investment management costs, trading costs, and turnover-induced taxes; such costs would have to be judged relative to the lower costs of index alternatives, which vary by asset class.
 ■Tax status. Holding other variables constant, taxable investors would tend to have higher hurdles to profitable active management than tax-exempt investors.
32 For taxable investors who want to hold both passive and active 
investments, active investments would be held, in general, in available tax-advantaged accounts.
The curriculum readings on equity, fixed-income, and alternative investments 
will explore many strategies and the nature of any active decisions involved. Investors 
do need to understand the nature of the active decisions involved in implementing 
their strategic asset allocations and their appropriateness given the factors described. 
Exhibit 14 shows qualitatively (rather than precisely) some choices that investors may 
consider for equity and fixed-income allocations. In the exhibit, non-cap-weighted indexing includes such approaches as equal weighting and quantitative rules-based indexing approaches (discussed further in the equity readings).

asset allocation.
Solution:
One choice relates to whether to allow active deviations from the strategic asset allocation. Tactical asset allocation and dynamic asset allocation are examples of active management of asset allocations. A second set of choices relates to where to invest allocations to asset classes along the passive/active spectrum.

2. An e quity index is described as “a rules-based, transparent index designed 
to provide investors with an efficient way to gain exposure to large-cap and 
small-cap stocks with low total return variability. ” Compared with the mar-ket-cap weighting of the parent index (with the same component securities), the weights in the low-volatility index are proportional to the inverse of return volatility, so that the highest-volatility security receives the lowest weight. Describe the active and passive aspects of a decision to invest an allocation to equities in ETFs tracking such indices.
Solution:
The active element is the decision, relative to the parent index, to over-weight securities with low volatility and underweight securities with high volatility. This management of risk is distinct from reducing portfolio volatility by combining a market-cap-weighted index with a risk-free asset proxy because it implies a belief in some risk–return advantage to favoring low-volatility equities on an individual security basis. The passive element is a transparent rules-based implementation of the weighting scheme based on inverse volatilities.

active and passive choices.
Solution:
The passive choice is represented by the overall selection of the universe of global bonds; however, the active choice is represented by the weighting scheme, which is to use GDP rather than capital market weights. This is a tilt toward the real economy and away from fixed-income market values.

For a large investor like the Caflandia sovereign wealth fund (CAF$40 bil-

If only a small percentage of portfolio assets can be invested effectively in an active strategy, for example, the potential value added for the overall portfolio may not justify the inherent costs and management time.

Risk Budgeting Perspectives in Asset Allocation and 
Implementation
Risk budgeting addresses the questions of which types of risks to take and how much 
of each to take. Risk budgeting provides another view of asset allocation—through 
a risk lens. Depending on the focus, the risk may be quantified in various ways. For example, a concern for volatility can be quantified as variance or standard deviation of returns, and a concern for tail risk can be quantified as VaR or drawdown. Risk budgets (budgets for risk taking) can be stated in absolute or in relative terms and in money or percent terms. For example, it is possible to state an overall risk budget for a portfolio in terms of volatility of returns, which would be an example of an absolute risk budget stated in percent terms (for example, 20% for portfolio return volatility). 
Risk budgeting is a tool that may be useful in a variety of contexts and asset allocation 
approaches.
Some investors may approach asset allocation with an exclusive focus on risk. A 
risk budgeting approach to asset allocation has been defined as an approach in which 
the investor specifies how risk (quantified by some measure, such as volatility) is to be 
distributed across assets in the portfolio, without consideration of the assets’ expected 
returns.34 An example is aiming for equal expected risk contributions to overall port -
folio volatility from all included asset classes as an approach to diversification, which is a risk parity (or equal risk contribution) approach. A subsequent reading in asset allocation addresses this in greater detail.
More directly related to the choice of passive/active implementation are active risk 
budgets and active risk budgeting. Active risk budgeting addresses the question of how 
much benchmark-relative risk an investor is willing to take in seeking to outperform a benchmark. This approach is risk budgeting stated in benchmark-relative terms. In parallel to the two dimensions of the passive/active decision outlined previously are two levels of active risk budgeting, which can be distinguished as follows:
 ■At the level of the overall asset allocation, active risk can be defined relative to the strategic asset allocation benchmark. This benchmark may be the strategic asset allocation weights applied to specified (often, broad-based market-cap-weighted) indices.
 ■At the level of individual asset classes, active risk can be defined relative to the asset class benchmark.
Active risk budgeting at the level of overall asset allocation would be relevant to 
tactical asset allocation. Active risk budgeting at the level of each asset class is relevant 
to how the allocation to those asset classes is invested. For example, it can take the form

Learning Module 3  O verview of Asset Allocation 182
of expected-alpha versus tracking-error optimization in a manner similar to classic 
mean–variance optimization. If investment factor risks are the investor’s focus, risk budgeting can be adapted to have a focus on allocating factor risk exposures instead. Later readings revisit risk budgeting in investing in further detail.
REBALANCING: STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS
discuss strategic considerations in rebalancing asset allocations
Rebalancing is the discipline of adjusting portfolio weights to more closely align with 
the strategic asset allocation. Rebalancing is a key part of the monitoring and feedback 
step of the portfolio construction, monitoring, and revision process. An investor’s rebalancing policy is generally documented in the IPS.
Even in the absence of changing investor circumstances, a revised economic outlook, 
or tactical asset allocation views, normal changes in asset prices cause the portfolio asset mix to deviate from target weights. Industry practice defines “rebalancing” as portfolio adjustments triggered by such price changes. Other portfolio adjustments, even systematic ones, are not rebalancing.
Ordinary price changes cause the assets with a high forecast return to grow faster 
than the portfolio as a whole. Because high-return assets are typically also higher risk, in the absence of rebalancing, overall portfolio risk rises. The mix of risks within the portfolio becomes more concentrated as well. Systematic rebalancing maintains the original strategic risk exposures. The discipline of rebalancing serves to control portfolio risks that have become different from what the investor originally intended.
Consider the example from the internet bubble (1995–2001) in Exhibit 15. The 
example assumes a 60/40 stock/bond portfolio, in which stocks are represented by 
the large-cap US growth stocks that characterized the internet bubble. In Panel B, the 
left-hand scale and upper two lines show month-by-month total portfolio values with 
and without monthly rebalancing (“wealth rebalanced” and “wealth unrebalanced, ” respectively). The right-hand scale and lower two lines show month-by-month port -
folio risk as represented by the 5th percentile drawdown (in a VaR model) with and 
without monthly rebalancing (“risk rebalanced” and “risk unrebalanced, ” respectively).11

Because rebalancing is countercyclical, it is fundamentally a contrarian investment 
approach.35 Behavioral finance tells us that such contrarianism will be uncomfortable; 
no one likes to sell the most recently best-performing part of the portfolio to buy the 
worst. Thus, rebalancing is a discipline  of adjusting the portfolio to better align with 
the strategic asset allocation in both connotations of discipline—the sense of a typical 
practice and the sense of a strengthening regime.
35 A qu antitative interpretation of rebalancing, given by Ang (2014), is that the return to rebalancing is selling out of the money puts and calls.

A Framework for Rebalancing
The actual mechanics of rebalancing are more complex than they first appear. A num-
ber of questions arise: How often should the portfolio be rebalanced? What levels of 
imbalance are worth tolerating? Should the portfolio be rebalanced to the edge of the policy range or to some other point? These non-trivial questions represent the key strategic decisions in rebalancing.
The simplest approach to rebalancing is calendar rebalancing, which involves 
rebalancing a portfolio to target weights on a periodic basis—for example, monthly, 
quarterly, semiannually, or annually. The choice of rebalancing frequency may be 
linked to the schedule of portfolio reviews. Although simple, rebalancing points are arbitrary and have other disadvantages.
Percent-range rebalancing permits tighter control of the asset mix compared with 
calendar rebalancing. Percent-range approach involves setting rebalancing thresholds 
or trigger points, stated as a percentage of the portfolio’s value, around target values. For example, if the target allocation to an asset class is 50% of portfolio value, trigger points at 45% and 55% of portfolio value define a 10 percentage point rebalancing range (or corridor) for the value of that asset class. The rebalancing range creates a no-trade region. The portfolio is rebalanced when an asset class’s weight first passes 
through one of its trigger points. Focusing on percent-range rebalancing, the following 
questions are relevant:
 ■How frequently is the portfolio valued?
 ■What size deviation triggers rebalancing?
 ■Is the deviation from the target allocation fully or partially corrected?
How frequently is the portfolio valued? The percent-range discipline requires 
monitoring portfolio values for breaches of a trigger point at an agreed-on frequency; 
the more frequent the monitoring, the greater the precision in implementation. Such 
monitoring may be scheduled daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually. A number 
of considerations—including governance resources and asset custodian resources—can affect valuation frequency. For many investors, monthly or quarterly evaluation efficiently balances the costs and benefits of rebalancing.
What size deviation triggers rebalancing? Trigger points take into account such 
factors as traditional practice, transaction costs, asset class volatility, volatility of the 
balance of the portfolio, correlation of the asset class with the balance of the portfolio, 
and risk tolerance.36
Before the rise of modern multi-asset portfolios, the stock/bond split broadly char -
acterized the asset allocation and a traditional ±x % rebalancing band was common. 
These fixed ranges would apply no matter the size or volatility of the allocation target. 
For example, both a 40% domestic equity allocation and a 15% real asset allocation might have ±5% rebalancing ranges. Alternatively, proportional bands reflect the size of the target weight. For example, a 60% target asset class might have a ±6% band, whereas a 5% allocation would have a ±0.5% band. Proportional bands might also be set to reflect the relative volatility of the asset classes. A final approach is the use of cost–benefit analysis to set ranges.
Is the deviation from the target allocation fully or partially corrected? Once the 
portfolio is evaluated and an unacceptably large deviation found, the investor must determine rebalancing trade size, as well as the timeline for implementing the rebal-
ancing. In practice, three main approaches are used: rebalance back to target weights, 
rebalance to range edge, or rebalance halfway between the range-edge trigger point and the target weight.

Rebalancing: Strategic considerations 185
Strategic Considerations in Rebalancing
The four-part rebalancing framework just described highlights important questions 
to address in setting rebalancing policy. Strategic considerations generally include the 
following, all else being equal:
 ■Higher transaction costs for an asset class imply wider rebalancing ranges.
 ■More risk-averse investors will have tighter rebalancing ranges.
 ■Less correlated assets also have tighter rebalancing ranges.
 ■Beliefs in momentum favor wider rebalancing ranges, whereas mean rever -
sion encourages tighter ranges.
 ■Illiquid investments complicate rebalancing.
 ■Derivatives create the possibility of synthetic rebalancing.
 ■Taxes, which are a cost, discourage rebalancing and encourage asymmetric 
and wider rebalancing ranges.
Asset class volatility is also a consideration in the size of rebalancing ranges.A cost–benefit approach to rebalancing sets ranges, taking transaction costs, risk 
aversion, asset class risks, and asset class correlations into consideration. For exam-ple, an asset that is more highly correlated with the rest of the portfolio than another would merit a wider rebalancing range, all else equal, because it would be closer to being a substitute for the balance of the portfolio; thus, larger deviations would have less impact on portfolio risk.
EXAMPLE 10
Different Rebalancing Ranges
1. The t able shows a simple four-asset strategic mix along with rebalancing 
ranges created under different approaches. The width of the rebalancing range under the proportional range approach is 0.20 of the strategic target.
State a reason that could explain why the international equity range is wider 
than the domestic equity range using the cost–benefit approach.

Fixed income 20% 15%–25% 18%–22% 19%–21%
 
Solution:
Higher transaction costs for international equity compared with domestic 
equity could explain the wider range for international equity compared with domestic equity under the cost–benefit approach. Another potential explanation relates to the possibility that international equity has a higher correlation with the balance of the portfolio (i.e., the portfolio excluding international equity) than does domestic equity (i.e., with the portfolio ex-

cluding domestic equity). If that is the case then, all else being equal, a wider 
band would be justified for international equity.
Investors’ perspectives on capital markets can affect their approach to rebalancing. 
A belief in momentum and trend following, for example, encourages wider rebalanc -
ing ranges. In contrast, a belief in mean reversion encourages stricter adherence to rebalancing, including tighter ranges.
Illiquid assets complicate rebalancing. Relatively illiquid investments, such as hedge 
funds, private equity, or direct real estate, cannot be readily traded without substantial 
trading costs and/or delays. Accordingly, illiquid investments are commonly assigned 
wide rebalancing ranges. However, rebalancing of an illiquid asset may be affected indirectly when a highly correlated liquid asset can be traded or when exposure can be adjusted by means of positions in derivatives. For example, public equity could be 
reduced to offset an overweight in private equity. Rebalancing by means of highly cor -
related liquid assets and derivatives, however, involves some imprecision and basis risk.
This insight about liquidity is an instance where thinking ahead about rebalancing 
can affect the strategic asset allocation. It is one reason that allocations to illiquid assets are often smaller than if trading were possible.
Factor-based asset allocation, liability-relative investing, and goals-based investing, 
each a valid approach to asset allocation, can give rise to different rebalancing consid-
erations. Factor exposures and liability hedges require monitoring (and rebalancing) 
the factors weights and surplus duration in addition to asset class weights. Goals-based 
investing in private wealth management may require both asset class rebalancing and 
moving funds between different goal sub-portfolios.
Tax considerations also complicate rebalancing. Rebalancing typically realizes 
capital gains and losses, which are taxable events in many jurisdictions. For private 
wealth managers, any rebalancing benefit must be compared with the tax cost. Taxes, 
as a cost, are much larger than other transaction costs, which often leads to wider rebalancing ranges in taxable portfolios than in tax-exempt portfolios. Because loss 
harvesting generates tax savings and realizing gains triggers taxes, rebalancing ranges 
in taxable accounts may also be asymmetric. (For example, a 25% target asset class might have an allowable range of 24%–28%, which is −1% to +3%.)
Modern cost–benefit approaches to rebalancing suggest considering derivatives as 
a rebalancing tool. Derivatives can often be used to rebalance synthetically at much 
lower transaction costs than the costs of using the underlying stocks and bonds. 
Using a derivatives overlay also avoids disrupting the underlying separate accounts in a multi-manager implementation of the strategic asset allocation. Tax consider -
ations are also relevant; it may be more cost effective to reduce an exposure using a derivatives overlay than to sell the underlying asset and incur the capital gains tax liability. Lastly, trading a few derivatives may be quicker and easier than hundreds of underlying securities. Of course, using derivatives may require a higher level of risk oversight, but then risk control is the main rationale for rebalancing.
Estimates of the benefits of rebalancing vary. Many portfolios are statistically 
indistinguishable from each other, suggesting that much rebalancing is unnecessary. In 
contrast, Willenbrock (2011) demonstrates that even zero-return assets can, in theory, 
generate positive returns through rebalancing, which is a demonstrable (and surprising) 
benefit. Whatever the return estimate for the value added from rebalancing, the key takeaway is that rebalancing is chiefly about risk control, not return enhancement.

Rebalancing: Strategic considerations 187
SUMMARY
This reading has introduced the subject of asset allocation. Among the points made 
are the following:
 ■Effective investment governance ensures that decisions are made by individ-uals or groups with the necessary skills and capacity and involves artic -
ulating the long- and short-term objectives of the investment program; effectively allocating decision rights and responsibilities among the func -
tional units in the governance hierarchy; taking account of their knowledge, capacity, time, and position on the governance hierarchy; specifying pro-cesses for developing and approving the investment policy statement, which will govern the day-to-day operation of the investment program; specifying processes for developing and approving the program’s strategic asset alloca-tion; establishing a reporting framework to monitor the program’s progress toward the agreed-on goals and objectives; and periodically undertaking a governance audit. 
 ■The economic balance sheet includes non-financial assets and liabilities that can be relevant for choosing the best asset allocation for an investor’s financial portfolio.
 ■The investment objectives of asset-only asset allocation approaches focus on the asset side of the economic balance sheet; approaches with a liability-relative orientation focus on funding liabilities; and goals-based approaches focus on achieving financial goals.
 ■The risk concepts relevant to asset-only asset allocation approaches focus on asset risk; those of liability-relative asset allocation focus on risk in relation to paying liabilities; and a goals-based approach focuses on the probabilities of not achieving financial goals.
 ■Asset classes are the traditional units of analysis in asset allocation and reflect systematic risks with varying degrees of overlap.
 ■Assets within an asset class should be relatively homogeneous; asset classes should be mutually exclusive; asset classes should be diversifying; asset classes as a group should make up a preponderance of the world’s investable wealth; asset classes selected for investment should have the capacity to absorb a meaningful proportion of an investor’s portfolio.
 ■Risk factors are associated with non-diversifiable (i.e., systematic) risk and are associated with an expected return premium. The price of an asset and/or asset class may reflect more than one risk factor, and complicated spread positions may be necessary to identify and isolate particular risk factors. Their use as units of analysis in asset allocation is driven by considerations of controlling systematic risk exposures.
 ■The global market portfolio represents a highly diversified asset allocation that can serve as a baseline asset allocation in an asset-only approach.
 ■There are two dimensions of passive/active choices. One dimension relates to the management of the strategic asset allocation itself—for example, whether to deviate from it tactically or not. The second dimension relates to passive and active implementation choices in investing the allocation to a given asset class. Tactical and dynamic asset allocation relate to the first dimension; active and passive choices for implementing allocations to asset classes relate to the second dimension.

 ■Risk budgeting addresses the question of which types of risks to take and 
how much of each to take. Active risk budgeting addresses the question of how much benchmark-relative risk an investor is willing to take. At the level of the overall asset allocation, active risk can be defined relative to the strategic asset allocation benchmark. At the level of individual asset classes, active risk can be defined relative to the benchmark proxy.
 ■Rebalancing is the discipline of adjusting portfolio weights to more closely align with the strategic asset allocation. Rebalancing approaches include calendar-based and range-based rebalancing. Calendar-based rebalancing rebalances the portfolio to target weights on a periodic basis. Range-based rebalancing sets rebalancing thresholds or trigger points around target weights. The ranges may be fixed width, percentage based, or volatility based. Range-based rebalancing permits tighter control of the asset mix compared with calendar rebalancing.
 ■Strategic considerations in rebalancing include transaction costs, risk aversion, correlations among asset classes, volatility, and beliefs concerning momentum, taxation, and asset class liquidity.

PRACTICE PROBLEMS
The following information relates to questions 
1-8
Meg and Cramer Law, a married couple aged 42 and 44, respectively, are meet-ing with their new investment adviser, Daniel Raye. The Laws have worked their entire careers at Whorton Solutions (WS), a multinational technology company. The Laws have two teenage children who will soon begin college.
Raye reviews the Laws’ current financial position. The Laws have an investment 
portfolio consisting of $800,000 in equities and $450,000 in fixed-income instru-ments. Raye notes that 80% of the equity portfolio consists of shares of WS. The Laws also own real estate valued at $400,000, with $225,000 in mortgage debt. Raye estimates the Laws’ pre-retirement earnings from WS have a total present value of $1,025,000. He estimates the Laws’ future expected consumption expen-ditures have a total present value of $750,000.
The Laws express a very strong desire to fund their children’s college education 
expenses, which have an estimated present value of $275,000. The Laws also plan to fund an endowment at their alma mater in 20 years, which has an estimated present value of $500,000. The Laws tell Raye they want a high probability of suc-cess funding the endowment. Raye uses this information to prepare an economic balance sheet for the Laws.
In reviewing a financial plan written by the Laws’ previous adviser, Raye notices 
the following asset class specifications.
Equity: US equities
Debt: Global investment-grade corporate bonds and real estate
Derivatives: Primarily large-capitalization foreign equities
The previous adviser’s report notes the asset class returns on equity and deriva-tives are highly correlated. The report also notes the asset class returns on debt have a low correlation with equity and derivative returns.
Raye is concerned that the asset allocation approach followed by the Laws’ previ-
ous financial adviser resulted in an overlap in risk factors among asset classes for the portfolio. Raye plans to address this by examining the portfolio’s sensitivity to various risk factors, such as inflation, liquidity, and volatility, to determine the desired exposure to each factor.
Raye concludes that a portfolio of 75% global equities and 25% bonds reflects an 
appropriate balance of expected return and risk for the Laws with respect to a 20-year time horizon for most moderately important goals. Raye recommends the Laws follow a goals-based approach to asset allocation and offers three pos-sible portfolios for the Laws to consider. Selected data on the three portfolios are presented in Exhibit 1.

SOLUTIONS
1. A i s correct. The Laws’ economic net worth is closest to $925,000. An econom-
ic balance sheet includes conventional financial assets and liabilities, as well as 
extended portfolio assets and liabilities that are relevant in making asset alloca-tion decisions. The economic balance sheet for the Law family is shown in the following exhibit.
Assets   Liabilities and Economic Net Worth
Financial Assets  Financial Liabilities
Fixed income 450,000  Mortgage debt 225,000
Real estate 400,000      
Equity 800,000      
         
         
Extended Assets  Extended Liabilities
Human capital 1,025,000  Children’s education 275,000
     Endowment funding 500,000
     Present value of consumption 750,000
         
Total Economic Assets 2,675,000  Total Economic Liabilities 1,750,000
         
     Economic Net Worth 925,000
Economic net worth is equal to total economic assets minus total economic lia-bilities ($2,675,000 – $1,750,000 = $925,000).
2.
 A i
s correct. The Laws’ equity portfolio is heavily concentrated in WS stock (80% 
of the equity portfolio), and both Laws work at WS. Should WS encounter dif-ficult economic circumstances, the investment value of WS stock and the Laws’ human capital are both likely to be adversely affected. Thus, their investment in WS should be reviewed and their equity portfolio diversified further.
3.
 C i
s correct. In order to effectively specify asset classes for the purpose of asset 
allocation, assets within an asset class should be relatively homogeneous and have similar attributes. The previous adviser’s specification of the debt asset class includes global investment-grade corporate bonds and real estate. This definition results in a non-homogeneous asset class.
4.
 A i
s correct. For risk control purposes, an asset class should be diversifying and 
should not have extremely high expected correlations with other classes. Because the returns to the equity and the derivatives asset classes are noted as being highly correlated, inclusion of both asset classes will result in duplication of risk exposures. Including both asset classes is not diversifying to the asset allocation.
5.
 B i
s correct. Raye believes the Laws’ previous financial adviser followed an asset 
allocation approach that resulted in an overlap in risk factors among asset classes. A multifactor risk model approach can be used to address potential risk factor overlaps. Risk factor approaches to asset allocation focus on assigning invest-ments to the investor’s desired exposures to specified risk factors. These methods are premised on the observation that asset classes often exhibit some overlaps in

sources of risk.
6.
 A i
s correct. Portfolio 1 best meets the Laws’ education goal for their children. 
The estimated present value of the Laws’ expected education expense is $275,000. 
Given that the children will be starting college soon, and the Laws have a very strong desire to achieve this goal, Portfolio 1, which stresses liquidity and stabili-ty, is most appropriate to meet the Laws’ short-term education goal.
7.
 B i
s correct. Portfolio 2 best meets the Laws’ goal to fund an endowment for their 
alma mater in 20 years. In present value terms, the gift is valued at $500,000, with the Laws desiring a high probability of achieving this goal. Although slightly more conservative than the 75/25 global equity/bond mix, Portfolio 2 has a greater growth emphasis compared with Portfolios 1 and 3. Therefore, Portfolio 2 is best for funding the endowment at their alma mater given the goal’s long-term hori-zon and the Laws’ desire for a high probability of achieving it.
8.
 B i
s correct. Using the cost–benefit approach, higher transaction costs for an 
asset class imply wider rebalancing ranges. Raye’s recommendation for a wider rebalancing range for global equities is consistent with the presence of higher transaction costs for global equities.

INTRODUCTION
Determining a strategic asset allocation is arguably the most important aspect of the 
investment process. This reading builds on the “Introduction to Asset Allocation” reading and focuses on several of the primary frameworks for developing an asset 
allocation, including asset-only mean–variance optimization, various liability-relative 
asset allocation techniques, and goals-based investing. Additionally, it touches on various other asset allocation techniques used by practitioners, as well as important related topics, such as rebalancing.
The process of creating a diversified, multi-asset class portfolio typically involves 
two separate steps. The first step is the asset allocation decision, which can refer to both the process and the result of determining long-term (strategic) exposures to the available asset classes (or risk factors) that make up the investor’s opportunity set. Asset allocation is the first and primary step in translating the client’s circumstances, objectives, and constraints into an appropriate portfolio (or, for some approaches, 
multiple portfolios) for achieving the client’s goals within the client’s tolerance for risk. 
The second step in creating a diversified, multi-asset-class portfolio involves imple-mentation decisions that determine the specific investments (individual securities, pooled investment vehicles, and separate accounts) that will be used to implement the targeted allocations.
Although it is possible to carry out the asset allocation process and the imple-
mentation process simultaneously, in practice, these two steps are often separated for 
two reasons. First, the frameworks for simultaneously determining an asset allocation 
and its implementation are often complex. Second, in practice, many investors prefer to revisit their strategic asset allocation policy somewhat infrequently (e.g., annually or less frequently) in a dedicated asset allocation study, while most of these same investors prefer to revisit/monitor implementation vehicles (actual investments) far more frequently (e.g., monthly or quarterly).
Sections 2–9 cover the traditional mean–variance optimization (MVO) approach 
to asset allocation. We apply this approach in what is referred to as an “asset-only” setting, in which the goal is to create the most efficient mixes of asset classes in the absence of any liabilities. We highlight key criticisms of mean–variance optimization 
and methods used to address them. This section also covers risk budgeting in relation 
to asset allocation, factor-based asset allocation, and asset allocation with illiquid assets. The observation that almost all portfolios exist to help pay for what can be characterized as a “liability” leads to the next subject.
Sections 10–14 introduce liability-relative asset allocation—including a straight -
forward extension of mean–variance optimization known as surplus optimization. Surplus optimization is an economic balance sheet approach extended to the liability 
side of the balance sheet that finds the most efficient asset class mixes in the presence 
of liabilities. Liability-relative optimization is simultaneously concerned with the 
return of the assets, the change in value of the liabilities, and how assets and liabilities 
interact to determine the overall value or health of the total portfolio.
Sections 15–18 cover an increasingly popular approach to asset allocation called 
goals-based asset allocation. Conceptually, goals-based approaches are similar to 
liability-relative asset allocation in viewing risk in relation to specific needs or objec -
tives associated with different time horizons and degrees of urgency.
Section 19 introduces some informal (heuristic) ways that asset allocations have 
been determined and other approaches to asset allocation that emphasize specific objectives.1

In this section, we discuss several of the primary techniques and considerations 
involved in developing strategic asset allocations, leaving the issue of considering the liabilities to Sections 10–14 and the issue of tailoring the strategic asset allocation to meet specific goals to Sections 15–18.
We start by introducing mean–variance optimization, beginning with unconstrained 
optimization, prior to moving on to the more common mean–variance optimization problem in which the weights, in addition to summing to 1, are constrained to be positive (no shorting allowed). We present a detailed example, along with several variations, highlighting some of the important considerations in this approach. We also identify several criticisms of mean–variance optimization and the major ways these criticisms have been addressed in practice.
Mean–Variance Optimization: Overview
Mean–variance optimization (MVO), as introduced by Markowitz (1952, 1959), is 
perhaps the most common approach used in practice to develop and set asset allocation 
policy. Widely used on its own, MVO is also often the basis for more sophisticated approaches that overcome some of the limitations or weaknesses of MVO.
Markowitz recognized that whenever the returns of two assets are not perfectly 
correlated, the assets can be combined to form a portfolio whose risk (as measured by standard deviation or variance) is less than the weighted-average risk of the assets 
themselves. An additional and equally important observation is that as one adds assets 
to the portfolio, one should focus not on the individual risk characteristics of the addi-
tional assets but rather on those assets’ effect on the risk characteristics of the entire 
portfolio. Mean–variance optimization provides us with a framework for determining 
how much to allocate to each asset in order to maximize the expected return of the portfolio for an expected level of risk. In this sense, mean–variance optimization is a risk-budgeting tool that helps investors to spend their risk budget—the amount of risk they are willing to assume—wisely. We emphasize the word “expected” because 
the inputs to mean–variance optimization are necessarily forward-looking estimates, 
and the resulting portfolios reflect the quality of the inputs.

Learning Module 4  Principles of A sset Allocation 200
Mean–variance optimization requires three sets of inputs: returns, risks (stan-
dard deviations), and pair-wise correlations for the assets in the opportunity set. The 
objective function is often expressed as follows:
   U  m   = E   (   R  m   )     − 0.005λ  σ  m  2    (1)
wher
e
 
Um = the investor’s utility for asset mix (allocation) m
 
Rm = the return for asset mix m
 λ 
= the investor’s risk aversion coefficient
   σ  m  2    = the expected variance of return for asset mix m
The risk aversion coefficient (λ) characterizes the investor’s risk–return trade-off; 
in this context, it is the rate at which an investor will forgo expected return for less 
variance. The value of 0.005 in Equation 1 is based on the assumption that E(Rm) and 
σm are expressed as percentages rather than as decimals. (In using Equation 1, omit % 
signs.) If those quantities were expressed as decimals, the 0.005 would change to 0.5. For example, if E (R
m) = 0.10, λ = 2, and σ = 0.20 (variance is 0.04), then Um is 0.06, or 
6% [= 0.10 − 0.5(2)(0.04)]. In this case, Um can be interpreted as a certainty-equivalent 
return—that is, the utility value of the risky return offered by the asset mix, stated in terms of the risk-free return that the investor would value equally. In Equation 1, 0.005 merely scales the second term appropriately.
In words, the objective function says that the value of an asset mix for an investor is 
equal to the expected return of the asset mix minus a penalty that is equal to one-half of 
the expected variance of the asset mix scaled by the investor’s risk aversion coefficient. 
Optimization involves selecting the asset mix with the highest such value (certainty 
equivalent). Smaller risk aversion coefficients result in relatively small penalties for risk, 
leading to aggressive asset mixes. Conversely, larger risk aversion coefficients result in relatively large penalties for risk, leading to conservative asset mixes. A value of λ = 0 corresponds to a risk-neutral investor because it implies indifference to volatility. Most investors’ risk aversion is consistent with λ between 1 and 10.
2 Empirically, λ = 
4 can be taken to represent a moderately risk-averse investor, although the specific value is sensitive to the opportunity set in question and to market volatility.
In the absence of constraints, there is a closed-form solution that calculates, for a 
given set of inputs, the single set of weights (allocation) to the assets in the opportunity 
set that maximizes the investor’s utility. Typically, this single set of weights is relatively 
extreme, with very large long and short positions in each asset class. Except in the 
special case in which the expected returns are derived using the reverse-optimization 
process of Sharpe (1974), the expected-utility-maximizing weights will not add up to 100%. We elaborate on reverse optimization in Section 19.
In most real-world applications, asset allocation weights must add up to 100%, 
reflecting a fully invested, non-leveraged portfolio. From an optimization perspective, 
when seeking the asset allocation weights that maximize the investor’s utility, one must constrain the asset allocation weights to sum to 1 (100%). This constraint that weights sum to 100% is referred to as the “budget constraint” or “unity constraint. ” The inclusion of this constraint, or any other constraint, moves us from a problem that has a closed-form solution to a problem that must be solved numerically using optimization techniques.
In contrast to the single solution (single set of weights) that is often associated 
with unconstrained optimization (one could create an efficient frontier using uncon-
strained weights, but it is seldom done in practice), Markowitz’s mean–variance 
2 S ee Ang (2014, p. 44).

Asset-Only Asset Allocations and Mean–Variance Optimization 201
optimization paradigm is most often identified with an efficient frontier that plots all 
potential efficient asset mixes subject to some common constraints. In addition to a typical budget constraint that the weights must sum to 1 (100% in percentage terms), the next most common constraint allows only positive weights or allocations (i.e., no negative or short positions).
Efficient asset mixes are combinations of the assets in the opportunity set that 
maximize expected return per unit of expected risk or, alternatively (and equivalently), 
minimize expected risk for a given level of expected return. To find all possible effi-cient mixes that collectively form the efficient frontier, conceptually the optimizer 
iterates through all the possible values of the risk aversion coefficient (λ) and for 
each value finds the combination of assets that maximizes expected utility. We have used the word conceptually because there are different techniques for carrying out the optimization that may vary slightly from our description, even though the solu-tion (efficient frontier and efficient mixes) is the same. The efficient mix at the far left of the frontier with the lowest risk is referred to as the global minimum variance portfolio, while the portfolio at the far right of the frontier is the maximum expected return portfolio. In the absence of constraints beyond the budget and non-negativity constraints, the maximum expected return portfolio consists of a 100% allocation to the single asset with the highest expected return (which is not necessarily the asset with the highest level of risk).
RISK AVERSION
Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to precisely estimate a given investor’s risk 
aversion coefficient (λ). Best practices suggest that when estimating risk aversion 
(or, conversely, risk tolerance), one should examine both the investor’s preference  
for risk (willingness to take risk) and the investor’s capacity for taking risk. Risk 
preference is a subjective measure and typically focuses on how an investor feels 
about and potentially reacts to the ups and downs of portfolio value. The level of 
return an investor hopes to earn can influence the investor’s willingness to take risk, but investors must be realistic when setting such objectives. Risk capacity is an objective measure of the investor’s ability to tolerate portfolio losses and 
the potential decrease in future consumption associated with those losses.3 The 
psychometric literature has developed validated questionnaires, such as that of Grable and Joo (2004), to approximately locate an investor’s risk preference, although this result then needs to be blended with risk capacity to determine risk tolerance. For individuals, risk capacity is affected by factors such as net 
worth, income, the size of an emergency fund in relation to consumption needs, 
and the rate at which the individual saves out of gross income, according to the practice of financial planners noted in Grable (2008).
With this guidance in mind, we move forward with a relatively global opportu-
nity set, in this case defined from the point of view of an investor from the United Kingdom with an approximate 10-year time horizon. The analysis is carried out in British pounds (GBP), and none of the currency exposure is hedged. Exhibit 1 identi-fies 12 asset classes within the universe of available investments and a set of plausible forward-looking capital market assumptions: expected returns, standard deviations, and correlations. The reading on capital market expectations covers how such inputs may be developed.
4 In the exhibit, three significant digits at most are shown, but the 
subsequent analysis is based on full precision.
3 R isk preference and risk capacity are sometimes referred to as the willingness and the ability to take risk, respectively.4
 The st
andard deviations and correlations in Exhibit 1 are based on historical numbers, while expected 
returns come from reverse optimization (described later).

TIME HORIZON
Mean–variance optimization is a “single-period” framework in which the sin-
gle period could be a week, a month, a year, or some other time period. When 
working in a “strategic” setting, many practitioners typically find it most intuitive 
to work with annual capital market assumptions, even though the investment time horizon could be considerably longer (e.g., 10 years). If the strategic asset 
allocation will not be re-evaluated within a long time frame, capital market 
assumptions should reflect the average annual distributions of returns expected 
over the entire investment time horizon. In most cases, investors revisit the strategic asset allocation decision more frequently, such as annually or every three years, rerunning the analysis and making adjustments to the asset alloca-tion; thus, the annual capital market assumption often reflects the expectations associated with the evaluation horizon (e.g., one year or three years).

The classification of asset classes in the universe of available investments may 
vary according to local practices. For example, in the United States and some other 
larger markets, it is common to classify equities by market capitalization, whereas the practice of classifying equities by valuation (“growth” versus “value”) is less com-mon outside of the United States. Similarly, with regard to fixed income, some asset allocators may classify bonds based on various attributes—nominal versus inflation 
linked, corporate versus government issued, investment grade versus non-investment 
grade (high yield)—and/or by maturity/duration (short, intermediate, and long). By means of the non-negativity constraint and using a reverse-optimization procedure (to be explained later) based on asset class market values to generate expected return 
estimates, we control the typically high sensitivity of the composition of efficient port -
folios to expected return estimates (discussed further in Sections 19 and 20). Without 
such precautions, we would often find that efficient portfolios are highly concentrated 
in a subset of the available asset classes.
Running this set of capital market assumptions through a mean–variance opti-
mizer with the traditional non-negativity and unity constraints produces the efficient 
frontier depicted in Exhibit 2. We have augmented this efficient frontier with some non-traditional information that will assist with the understanding of some key con-cepts related to the efficient frontier. A risk-free return of 2.5% is used in calculating the reserve-optimized expected returns as well as the Sharpe ratios in Exhibit 2.

The slope of the efficient frontier is greatest at the far left of the efficient frontier, at 
the point representing the global minimum variance portfolio. Slope represents the rate at which expected return increases per increase in risk. As one moves to the right, in the direction of increasing risk, the slope decreases; it is lowest at the point representing the maximum return portfolio. Thus, as one moves from left to right along the efficient frontier, the investor takes on larger and larger amounts of risk for smaller and smaller increases in expected return. The “kinks” in the line representing 
the slope (times 10) of the efficient frontier correspond to portfolios (known as corner 
portfolios) in which an asset either enters or leaves the efficient mix.
For most investors, at the far left of the efficient frontier, the increases in expected 
return associated with small increases in expected risk represent a desirable trade-off. 
The risk aversion coefficient identifies the specific point on the efficient frontier at which the investor refuses to take on additional risk because he or she feels the asso-ciated increase in expected return is not high enough to compensate for the increase in risk. Of course, each investor makes this trade-off differently.
For this particular efficient frontier, the three expected utility curves plot the 
solution to Equation 1 for three different risk aversion coefficients: 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0, respectively.
5 For a given risk aversion coefficient, the appropriate efficient mix from 
the efficient frontier is simply the mix in which expected utility is highest (i.e., max -
imized). As illustrated in Exhibit 2, a lower risk aversion coefficient leads to a riskier (higher) point on the efficient frontier, while a higher risk aversion coefficient leads to a more conservative (lower) point on the efficient frontier.
The vertical line (at volatility of 10.88%) identifies the asset mix with the highest 
Sharpe ratio; it intersects the Sharpe ratio line at a value of 3.7 (an unscaled value of 0.37). This portfolio is also represented by the intersection of the slope line and the Sharpe ratio line.

Exhibit 3 is an efficient frontier asset allocation area graph. Each vertical cross 
section identifies the asset allocation at a point along the efficient frontier; thus, the 
vertical cross section at the far left, with nearly 100% cash, is the asset allocation of the minimum variance portfolio, and the vertical cross section at the far right, with 45% in emerging markets and 55% in global REITs, is the optimal asset allocation for a standard deviation of 20.5%, the highest level of portfolio volatility shown. In this example, cash is treated as a risky asset; although its return volatility is very low, because it is less than perfectly correlated with the other asset classes, mixing it with small amounts of other asset classes reduces risk further. The vertical line identifies 
the asset mix with the highest Sharpe ratio and corresponds to the similar line shown 
on the original efficient frontier graph (Exhibit 2). The asset allocation mixes are well diversified for most of the first half of the efficient frontier, and in fact, for a large portion of the efficient frontier, all 12 asset classes in our opportunity set receive a positive allocation.

The investment characteristics of potential asset mixes based on mean–variance theory 
are often further investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulation, as discussed in 
Section 3. Several observations from theory and practice are relevant to narrowing the choices.
Equation 1 indicates that the basic approach to asset allocation involves estimating 
the investor’s risk aversion parameter and then finding the efficient mix that maximizes 
expected utility. When the risk aversion coefficient has not been estimated, the investor 
may be able to identify the maximum tolerable level of portfolio return volatility. If 
6 S tudying Exhibit 3 closely, one notices distinct regime shifts where the rate at which allocations are made to asset classes changes so that a line segment with a different slope begins. These regime shifts occur at what are called corner portfolios. The efficient mixes between two adjacent corner portfolios are simply linear combinations of those portfolios. The efficient frontier asset allocation area graph helps to clarify this result. More formally, corner portfolios are points on the efficient frontier at which an asset 
class either enters or leaves the efficient mix or a constraint either becomes binding or is no longer binding.

that level is 10% per annum, for example, only the part of the efficient frontier asso-
ciated with volatility less than or equal to 10% is relevant. This approach is justifiable because for a given efficient frontier, every value of the risk aversion coefficient can be associated with a value of volatility that identifies the best point on the efficient 
frontier for the investor; the investor may also have experience with thinking in terms 
of volatility. In addition, when the investor has a numerical return objective, he or she 
can further narrow the range of potential efficient mixes by identifying the efficient 
portfolios expected to meet that return objective. For example, if the return objective 
is 5%, one can select the asset allocation with a 5% expected return.
Example 1 illustrates the use of Equation 1 and shows the adaptability of MVO by 
introducing the choice problem in the context of an investor who also has a shortfall risk concern.
EXAMPLE 1
Mean–Variance-Efficient Portfolio Choice 1
An investment adviser is counseling Aimée Goddard, a client who recently 
inherited €1,200,000 and who has above-average risk tolerance (λ = 2). Because Goddard is young and one of her goals is to fund a comfortable retirement, she wants to earn returns that will outpace inflation in the long term. Goddard expects to liquidate €60,000 of the inherited portfolio in 12 months to fund the down payment on a house. She states that it is important for her to be able to take out the €60,000 without invading the initial capital of €1,200,000. Exhibit 4 shows three alternative strategic asset allocations.

 Re
commend and justify a strategic asset allocation for Goddard.
Solution:
Because €60,000/€1,200,000 is 5.0%, for any return less than 5.0%, Goddard will need to invade principal when she liquidates €60,000. So 5% is a thresh-old return level.
To decide which of the three allocations is best for Goddard, we calculate 
the ratio [E(R
P) − RL]/σP:
Allocation A
 (10% − 5%)/20% = 0.25
Allo
cation B
 (7% − 5%)/10% = 0.20
Allo
cation C
 (5.25% − 5%)/5% = 0.05
B
oth Allocations A and B have the same expected utility, but Allocation A 
has a higher probability of meeting the threshold 5% return than Allocation B. Therefore, A would be the recommended strategic asset allocation.
There are several different approaches to determining an allocation to cash and 
cash equivalents, such as government bills. Exhibit 1 included cash among the assets for which we conducted an optimization to trace out an efficient frontier. The return 
to cash over a short time horizon is essentially certain in nominal terms. One approach 
to asset allocation separates out cash and cash equivalents as a (nominally) risk-free asset and calculates an efficient frontier of risky assets. Alternatively, a ray from the risk-free rate (a point on the return axis) tangent to the risky-asset efficient frontier

Learning Module 4  Principles of A sset Allocation 208
(with cash excluded) then defines a linear efficient frontier. The efficient frontier then 
consists of combinations of the risk-free asset with the tangency portfolio (which has the highest Sharpe ratio among portfolios on the risky-asset efficient frontier).
A number of standard finance models (including Tobin two-fund separation) adopt 
this treatment of cash. According to two-fund separation, if investors can borrow or lend at the risk-free rate, they will choose the tangency portfolio for the risky-asset holdings and borrow at the risk-free rate to leverage the position in that portfolio to achieve a higher expected return, or they will split money between the tangency 
portfolio and the risk-free asset to reach a position with lower risk and lower expected 
return than that represented by the tangency portfolio. Since over horizons that are longer than the maturity of a money market instrument, the return earned would not be known, another approach that is well established in practice and reflected in Exhibit 1 is to include cash in the optimization. The amount of cash indicated by an 
optimization may be adjusted in light of short-term liquidity needs; for example, some 
financial advisers advocate that individuals hold an amount of cash equivalent to six months of expenses. All of these approaches are reasonable alternatives in practice.
Although we will treat cash as a risky asset in the following discussions, in Example 
2, we stop to show the application of the alternative approach based on distinguishing 
a risk-free asset.
EXAMPLE 2
A Strategic Asset Allocation Based on Distinguishing a 
Nominal Risk-Free Asset
The Caflandia Foundation for the Fine Arts (CFFA) is a hypothetical charitable 
organization established to provide funding to Caflandia museums for their art acquisition programs.
CFFA’s overall investment objective is to maintain its portfolio’s real purchas -
ing power after distributions. CFFA targets a 4% annual distribution of assets. CFFA has the following current specific investment policies.
Return objective
CFFA’s assets shall be invested with the objective of earning an average nominal 
6.5% annual return. This level reflects a spending rate of 4%, an expected inflation 
rate of 2%, and a 40 bp cost of earning investment returns. The calculation is (1.04)(1.02)(1.004) − 1 = 0.065, or 6.5%.
Risk considerations
CFFA’s assets shall be invested to minimize the level of standard deviation of return subject to satisfying the expected return objective.
The investment office of CFFA distinguishes a nominally risk-free asset. 
As of the date of the optimization, the risk-free rate is determined to be 2.2%.
Exhibit 5 gives key outputs from a mean–variance optimization in which 
asset class weights are constrained to be non-negative.

ased only on the facts given, determine the most appropriate strategic 
asset allocation for CFFA given its stated investment policies.
Solution:
An 85%/15% combination of Portfolio 4 and the risk-free asset is the most 
appropriate asset allocation. This combination has the required 6.5% expect-ed return with the minimum level of risk. Stated another way, this combina-tion defines the efficient portfolio at a 6.5% level of expected return based on the linear efficient frontier created by the introduction of a risk-free asset.
Note that Portfolio 4 has the highest Sharpe ratio and is the tangency port-
folio. With an expected return of 7.24%, it can be combined with the risk-free asset, with a return of 2.2%, to achieve an expected return of 6.5%:
6.50 = 7.24w  + 2.2(1 − w)
w = 0.853
Placing about 85% of assets in Portfolio 4 and 15% in the risk-free asset achieves an efficient portfolio with expected return of 6.5 with a volatili-ty of 0.853(11.65) = 9.94%. (The risk-free asset has no return volatility by assumption and, also by assumption, zero correlation with any risky port-folio return.) This portfolio lies on a linear efficient frontier formed by a ray from the risk-free rate to the tangency portfolio and can be shown to have the same Sharpe ratio as the tangency portfolio, 0.433. The combination of Portfolio 4 with Portfolio 5 to achieve a 6.5% expected return would have a lower Sharpe ratio and would not lie on the efficient frontier.
Asset allocation decisions have traditionally been made considering only the 
investor’s investment portfolio (and financial liabilities) and not the total picture that 
includes human capital and other non-traded assets (and liabilities), which are missing 
in a traditional balance sheet. Taking such extended assets and liabilities into account 
can lead to improved asset allocation decisions, however.
Depending on the nature of an individual’s career, human capital can provide 
relatively stable cash flows similar to bond payments. At the other extreme, the cash 
flows from human capital can be much more volatile and uncertain, reflecting a lumpy, 
commission-based pay structure or perhaps a career in a seasonal business. For many 
individuals working in stable job markets, the cash flows associated with their human 
capital are somewhat like those of an inflation-linked bond, relatively consistent and tending to increase with inflation. If human capital is a relatively large component of

the individual’s total economic worth, accounting for this type of hidden asset in an 
asset allocation setting is extremely important and would presumably increase the individual’s capacity to take on risk.
Let us look at a hypothetical example. Emma Beel is a 45-year-old tenured university 
professor in London. Capital market assumptions are as before (see Exhibit 1). Beel has GBP 1,500,000 in liquid financial assets, largely due to a best-selling book. Her employment as a tenured university professor is viewed as very secure and produces cash flows that resemble those of a very large, inflation-adjusted, long-duration bond 
portfolio. The net present value of her human capital is estimated at GBP 500,000. Beel 
inherited her grandmother’s home on the edge of the city, valued at GBP 750,000. The 
results of a risk tolerance questionnaire that considers both risk preference and risk capacity suggest that Beel should have an asset allocation involving moderate risk. Furthermore, given our earlier assumption that the collective market risk aversion 
coefficient is 4.0, we assume that the risk aversion coefficient of a moderately risk-averse 
investor is approximately 4.0, from a total wealth perspective.
To account for Beel’s human capital and residential real estate, these two asset 
classes were modeled and added to the optimization. Beel’s human capital of GBP 500,000 was modeled as 70% UK long-duration inflation-linked bonds, 15% UK cor -
porate bonds, and 15% UK equities.
8 Residential real estate was modeled based on a 
de-smoothed residential property index for London. (We will leave the complexities of 
modeling liabilities to Sections 10–14.) Beel’s assets include those shown in Exhibit 6.
Exhibit 6: Emma Beel’s Assets
Asset Value (GBP) Percentage
Liquid financial assets 1,500,000 54.55
UK residential real estate 750,000 27.27
Human capital 500,000 18.18
  2,750,000 100
Beel’s UK residential real estate (representing the London house) and human capital 
were added to the optimization opportunity set. Additionally, working under the 
assumption that Beel’s house and human capital are non-tradable assets, the opti-mizer was forced to allocate 27.27% or more to UK residential real estate and 18.18% to human capital and then determined the optimal asset allocation based on a risk aversion coefficient of 4. Beel’s expected utility is maximized by an efficient asset allocation with volatility of approximately 8.2%. Exhibit 7 displays the resulting asset allocation area graph.
8 Th ese weights were used to create the return composite representing Beel’s human capital that was used 
in the asset allocation optimization.

Looking past the constrained allocations to human capital and UK residential real

MONTE CARLO SIMULATION

Monte Carlo simulation complements MVO by addressing the limitations of MVO as a single-period framework. Additionally, in the case in which the investor’s risk tolerance is either unknown or in need of further validation, Monte Carlo simula-
tion can help paint a realistic picture of potential future outcomes, including the 
likelihood of meeting various goals, the distribution of the portfolio’s expected value through time, and potential maximum drawdowns. Simulation also provides a tool 
for investigating the effects of trading/rebalancing costs and taxes and the interaction 
of evolving financial markets with asset allocation. It is important to note that not all Monte Carlo simulation tools are the same: They vary significantly in their ability

to model non-normal multivariate returns, serial and cross-correlations, tax rates, 
distribution requirements, an evolving asset allocation schedule (target-date glide 
path), non-traditional investments (e.g., annuities), and human capital (based on age, 
geography, education, and/or occupation).
Using Monte Carlo simulation, an investment adviser can effectively grapple with 
a range of practical issues that are difficult or impossible to formulate analytically. 
Consider rebalancing to a strategic asset allocation for a taxable investor. We can readily 
calculate the impact of taxes during a single time period. Also, in a single-period set -
ting, as assumed by MVO, rebalancing is irrelevant. In the multi-period world of most 
investment problems, however, the portfolio will predictably be rebalanced, triggering 
the realization of capital gains and losses. Given a specific rebalancing rule, different 
strategic asset allocations will result in different patterns of tax payments (and different 
transaction costs too). Formulating the multi-period problem mathematically would be a daunting challenge. We could more easily incorporate the interaction between rebalancing and taxes in a Monte Carlo simulation.
We will examine a simple multi-period problem to illustrate the use of Monte 
Carlo simulation, evaluating the range of outcomes for wealth that may result from a strategic asset allocation (and not incorporating taxes).
The value of wealth at the terminal point of an investor’s time horizon is a pos -
sible criterion for choosing among asset allocations. Future wealth incorporates the interaction of risk and return. The need for Monte Carlo simulation in evaluating an asset allocation depends on whether there are cash flows into or out of the portfolio over time. For a given asset allocation with no cash flows, the sequence of returns is irrelevant; ending wealth will be path independent (unaffected by the sequence or path of returns through time). With cash flows, the sequence is also irrelevant if simulated returns are independent, identically distributed random variables. We 
could find expected terminal wealth and percentiles of terminal wealth analytically.10 
Investors save/deposit money in and spend money out of their portfolios; thus, in the more typical case, terminal wealth is path dependent (the sequence of returns matters) because of the interaction of cash flows and returns. When terminal wealth is path dependent, an analytical approach is not feasible but Monte Carlo simulation 
is. Example 3 applies Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the strategic asset allocation 
of an investor who regularly withdraws from the portfolio.
EXAMPLE 3
Monte Carlo Simulation for a Retirement Portfolio with a 
Proposed Asset Allocation
Malala Ali, a resident of the hypothetical country of Caflandia, has sought the 
advice of an investment adviser concerning her retirement portfolio. At the end 
of 2017, she is 65 years old and holds a portfolio valued at CAF$1 million. Ali 
would like to withdraw CAF$40,000 a year to supplement the corporate pension 
she has begun to receive. Given her health and family history, Ali believes she 
should plan for a retirement lasting 25 years. She is also concerned about passing 
along a portion of her portfolio to the families of her three children; she hopes 
that at least the portfolio’s current real value can go to them. Consulting with her adviser, Ali has expressed this desire quantitatively: She wants the median value of her bequest to her children to be no less than her portfolio’s current 
value of CAF$1 million in real terms. The median is the 50th percentile outcome.

1. J ustify the presentation of ending wealth in terms of real rather than nomi-
nal wealth in Exhibit 9.
Solution:
Ali wants the median real value of her bequest to her children to be “no less 
than her portfolio’s current value of CAF$1 million. ” We need to state future amounts in terms of today’s values (i.e., in real dollars) to assess the pur-chasing power of those amounts relative to CAF$1 million today. Exhibit 9 thus gives the results of the Monte Carlo simulation in real dollar terms. The median real wealth at age 90 is clearly well below the target ending wealth of real CAF$1 million.
2.
 Is 
the current asset allocation expected to satisfy Ali’s investment objectives?
Solution:
From Exhibit 9, we see that the median terminal (at age 90) value of the retirement portfolio in real dollars is less than the stated bequest goal of CAF$1 million. Therefore, the most likely bequest is less than the amount Ali has said she wants. The current asset allocation is not expected to satisfy all her investment objectives. Although one potential lever would be to invest more aggressively, given Ali’s age and risk tolerance, this approach seems imprudent. An adviser may need to counsel that the desired size of the bequest may be unrealistic given Ali’s desired income to support her expenditures. Ali will likely need to make a relatively tough choice between her living standard (spending less) and her desire to leave a CAF$1 million bequest in real terms. A third alternative would be to delay retirement, which may or may not be feasible.
CRITICISMS OF MEAN–VARIANCE OPTIMIZATION
describe and evaluate the use of mean–variance optimization in asset allocation
With this initial understanding of mean–variance optimization, we can now elaborate 
on some of the most common criticisms of it. The following criticisms and the ways they have been addressed motivate the balance of the coverage of MVO:
1.
 The out
puts (asset allocations) are highly sensitive to small changes in the 
inputs.
2.
 The a
sset allocations tend to be highly concentrated in a subset of the avail-
able asset classes.
3.
 Man
y investors are concerned about more than the mean and variance of 
returns, the focus of MVO.
4.
 Alt
hough the asset allocations may appear diversified across assets, the 
sources of risk may not be diversified.
5.
 M
ost portfolios exist to pay for a liability or consumption series, and MVO 
allocations are not directly connected to what influences the value of the liability or the consumption series.4

Criticisms of Mean–Variance Optimization 215
6. MVO i s a single-period framework that does not take account of trading/
rebalancing costs and taxes.
In the rest of Sections 2–9, we look at various approaches to addressing criticisms 
1 and 2, giving some attention also to criticisms 3 and 4. Sections 10–18 present 
approaches to addressing criticism 5. “ Asset Allocation with Real World Constraints” 
addresses some aspects of criticism 6.
It is important to understand that the first criticism above is not unique to MVO. 
Any optimization model that uses forward-looking quantities as inputs faces similar 
consequences of treating input values as capable of being determined with certainty. 
Sensitivity to errors in inputs is a problem that cannot be fully solved because it 
is inherent in the structure of optimization models that use as inputs forecasts of uncertain quantities.
To illustrate the importance of the quality of inputs, the sensitivity of asset weights 
in efficient portfolios to small changes in inputs, and the propensity of mean–variance 
optimization to allocate to a relatively small subset of the available asset classes, we 
made changes to the expected return of two asset classes in our base-case UK-centric 
opportunity set in Exhibit 1. We increased the expected return of Asia Pacific ex Japan 
equities from 8.5% to 9.0% and decreased the expected return of Europe ex UK equities 
from 8.6% to 8.1% (both changes are approximately 50 bps). We left all of the other inputs unchanged and reran the optimization. The efficient frontier as depicted in 
mean–variance space appears virtually unchanged (not shown); however, the efficient 
asset mixes of this new efficient frontier are dramatically different. Exhibit 10 displays 
the efficient frontier asset allocation area graph based on the slightly changed capital market assumptions. Notice the dramatic difference between Exhibit 10 and Exhibit 
3. The small change in return assumptions has driven UK large cap, Europe ex-UK 
equities, and emerging market equities out of the efficient mixes, and the efficient mixes are now highly concentrated in a smaller subset of the available asset classes. Given that the expected returns of UK large cap and emerging market equities were unchanged, their disappearance from the efficient frontier is not intuitive.

ADDRESSING THE CRITICISMS OF MEAN–VARIANCE 
OPTIMIZATION
describe and evaluate the use of mean–variance optimization in 
asset allocation
In this section, we explore several methods for overcoming some of the potential short-comings of mean–variance optimization. Techniques that address the first two 
criticisms mostly take three approaches: improving the quality of inputs, constraining 
the optimization, and treating the efficient frontier as a statistical construct. These approaches are treated in the following three subsections.
In MVO, the composition of efficient portfolios is typically more sensitive to 
expected return estimates than it is to estimates of volatilities and correlations. 
Furthermore, expected returns are generally more difficult to estimate accurately than 
are volatilities and correlations. Thus, in addressing the first criticism of MVO—that outputs are highly sensitive to small changes in inputs—the reading will focus on expected return inputs. However, volatility and correlation inputs are also sources of potential error.
Reverse Optimization
Reverse optimization is a powerful tool that helps explain the implied returns asso-ciated with any portfolio. It can be used to estimate expected returns for use in a 
forward-looking optimization. MVO solves for optimal asset weights based on expected 
returns, covariances, and a risk aversion coefficient. Based on predetermined inputs, an optimizer solves for the optimal asset allocation weights. As the name implies, 
reverse optimization works in the opposite direction. Reverse optimization takes as its 
inputs a set of asset allocation weights that are assumed to be optimal and, with the 
additional inputs of covariances and the risk aversion coefficient, solves for expected returns. These reverse-optimized returns are sometimes referred to as implied or imputed returns.
When using reverse optimization to estimate a set of expected returns for use in a 
forward-looking optimization, the most common set of starting weights is the observed 
market-capitalization value of the assets or asset classes that form the opportunity set. 
The market capitalization of a given asset or asset classes should reflect the collective 5

Learning Module 4  Principles of A sset Allocation 218
information of market participants. In representing the world market portfolio, the 
use of non-overlapping asset classes representing the majority of the world’s investable 
assets is most consistent with theory.
Some practitioners will find the link between reverse optimization and CAPM 
equilibrium elegant, while others will see it as a shortcoming. For those who truly 
object to the use of market-capitalization weights in estimating inputs, the mechanics 
of reverse optimization can work with any set of starting weights—such as those of 
an existing policy portfolio, the average asset allocation policy of a peer group, or a 
fundamental weighting scheme. For those with more minor objections, we will shortly 
introduce the Black–Litterman model, which allows the expression of alternative 
forecasts or views.
In order to apply reverse optimization, one must create a working version of the 
all-inclusive market portfolio based on the constituents of the opportunity set. The market size or capitalization for most of the traditional stock and bond asset classes can be easily inferred from the various indexes that are used as asset class proxies. Many broad market-capitalization-weighted indexes report that they comprise over 
95% of the securities, by market capitalization, of the asset classes they are attempting 
to represent. Exhibit 12 lists approximate values and weights for the 12 asset classes in our opportunity set, uses the weights associated with the asset classes to form a working version of the global market portfolio, and then uses the beta of each asset relative to our working version of the global market portfolio to infer what expected returns would be if all assets were priced by the CAPM according to their market beta. We assume a risk-free rate of 2.5% and a global market risk premium of 4%. Note that expected returns are rounded to one decimal place from the more precise values shown later (in Exhibit 13); expected returns cannot in every case be exactly reproduced based on Exhibit 12 alone because of the approximations mentioned. Also, notice in the final row of Exhibit 12 that the weighted average return and beta of the assets are 6.5% and 1, respectively.

Addressing the Criticisms of Mean–Variance Optimization 219
Looking back at our original asset allocation area graph (Exhibit 3), the reason for 
the well-behaved and well-diversified asset allocation mixes is now clear. By using reverse optimization, we are consistently relating assets’ expected returns to their systematic risk. If there isn’t a consistent relationship between the expected return and systematic risk, the optimizer will see this inconsistency as an opportunity and seek to take advantage of the more attractive attributes. This effect was clearly visible 
in our second asset allocation area graph after we altered the expected returns of Asia 
Pacific ex Japan equities and Europe ex UK equities.
As alluded to earlier, some practitioners find that the reverse-optimization pro-
cess leads to a nice starting point, but they often have alternative forecasts or views regarding the expected return of one or more of the asset classes that differ from the 
returns implied by reverse optimization based on market-capitalization weights. One 
example of having views that differ from the reverse-optimized returns has already been illustrated, when we altered the returns of Asia Pacific ex Japan equities and Europe ex UK equities by approximately 50 bps. Unfortunately, due to the sensitiv -
ity of mean–variance optimization to small changes in inputs, directly altering the expected returns caused relatively extreme and unintuitive changes in the resulting asset allocations. If one has strong views on expected returns that differ from the reverse-optimized returns, an alternative or additional approach is needed; the next section presents one alternative.
Black–Litterman Model
A complementary addition to reverse optimization is the Black–Litterman model, created by Fischer Black and Robert Litterman (see Black and Litterman 1990, 1991, 1992). Although the Black–Litterman model is often characterized as an asset allo-cation model, it is really a model for deriving a set of expected returns that can be used in an unconstrained or constrained optimization setting. The Black–Litterman 
model starts with excess returns (in excess of the risk-free rate) produced from reverse 
optimization and then provides a technique for altering reverse-optimized expected returns in such a way that they reflect an investor’s own distinctive views yet still behave well in an optimizer.
The Black–Litterman model has helped make the mean–variance optimization 
framework more useful. It enables investors to combine their unique forecasts of 
expected returns with reverse-optimized returns in an elegant manner. When coupled 
with a mean–variance or related framework, the resulting Black–Litterman expected 
returns often lead to well-diversified asset allocations by improving the consistency between each asset class’s expected return and its contribution to systematic risk. 
These asset allocations are grounded in economic reality—via the market capitalization 
of the assets typically used in the reverse-optimization process—but still reflect the 
information contained in the investor’s unique forecasts (or views) of expected return.
The mathematical details of the Black–Litterman model are beyond the scope 
of this reading, but many practitioners have access to asset allocation software that includes the Black–Litterman model.
12 To assist with an intuitive understanding of 
the model and to show the model’s ability to blend new information (views) with reverse-optimized returns, we present an example based on the earlier views regard-ing the expected returns of Asia Pacific ex Japan equities and Europe ex UK equities. The Black–Litterman model has two methods for accepting views: one in which an absolute return forecast is associated with a given asset class and one in which the 
return differential of an asset (or group of assets) is expressed relative to another asset 
12 F or those interested in the mathematical details of the Black–Litterman model, see Idzorek (2007); a pre-publication version is available here: http://

(or group of assets). Using the relative view format of the Black–Litterman model, we 
expressed the view that we believe Asia Pacific ex Japan equities will outperform Europe 
ex UK equities by 100 bps. We placed this view into the Black–Litterman model, which 
blends reverse-optimized returns with such views to create a new, mixed estimate.
Exhibit 13 compares the Black–Litterman model returns to the original 
reverse-optimized returns (as in Exhibit 12 but showing returns to the second dec -
imal place based on calculations with full precision). The model accounts for the 
correlations of the assets with each other, and as one might expect, all of the returns 
change slightly (the change in return on cash was extremely small).

Next, we created another efficient frontier asset allocation area graph based on these new returns from the Black–Litterman model, as shown in Exhibit 14. The alloca-tions look relatively similar to those depicted in Exhibit 3. However, if you compare the allocations to Asia Pacific ex Japan equities and Europe ex UK equities to their 
allocations in the original efficient frontier asset allocation graph, you will notice that 
allocations to Asia Pacific ex Japan equities have increased across the frontier and 
allocations to Europe ex UK equities have decreased across the frontier with very little 
impact on the other asset allocations.

ADDING CONSTRAINTS BEYOND BUDGET 
CONSTRAINTS, RESAMPLED MVO AND OTHER NON-NORMAL OPTIMIZATION APPROACHES
When running an optimization, in addition to the typical budget constraint and the 
non-negativity constraint, one can impose additional constraints. There are two pri-mary reasons practitioners typically apply additional constraints: (1) to incorporate real-world constraints into the optimization problem and (2) to help overcome some 
of the potential shortcomings of mean–variance optimization elaborated above (input 
quality, input sensitivity, and highly concentrated allocations).
Most commercial optimizers accommodate a wide range of constraints. Typical 
constraints include the following:
1.
 S
pecify a set allocation to a specific asset—for example, 30% to real estate 
or 45% to human capital. This kind of constraint is typically used when one wants to include a non-tradable asset in the asset allocation decision and optimize around the non-tradable asset.
2.
 S
pecify an asset allocation range for an asset—for example, the emerging 
market allocation must be between 5% and 20%. This specification could be used to accommodate a constraint created by an investment policy, or it might reflect the user’s desire to control the output of the optimization.
3.
 S
pecify an upper limit, due to liquidity considerations, on an alternative 
asset class, such as private equity or hedge funds.
4.
 S
pecify the relative allocation of two or more assets—for example, the 
allocation to emerging market equities must be less than the allocation to developed equities.
5.
 In a li
ability-relative (or surplus) optimization setting, one can constrain the 
optimizer to hold one or more assets representing the systematic charac -
teristics of the liability short. (We elaborate on this scenario in Sections 10–14.)
In general, good constraints are those that model the actual circumstances/context 
in which one is attempting to set asset allocation policy. In contrast, constraints that are simply intended to control the output of a mean–variance optimization should be used cautiously. A perceived need to add constraints to control the MVO output 6

Adding Constraints beyond Budget Constraints, Resampled MVO and Other Non-Normal Optimization Approaches 223
would suggest a need to revisit one’s inputs. If a very large number of constraints are 
imposed, one is no longer optimizing but rather specifying an asset allocation through 
a series of binding constraints.
Resampled Mean–Variance Optimization
Another technique used by asset allocators is called resampled mean–variance 
optimization (or sometimes “resampling” for short).13 Resampled mean–variance 
optimization combines Markowitz’s mean–variance optimization framework with 
Monte Carlo simulation and, all else equal, leads to more-diversified asset allocations. 
In contrast to reverse optimization, the Black–Litterman model, and constraints, 
resampled mean–variance optimization is an attempt to build a better optimizer that 
recognizes that forward-looking inputs are inherently subject to error.
Resampling uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate a large number of potential 
capital market assumptions for mean–variance optimization and, eventually, for the 
resampled frontier. Conceptually, resampling is a large-scale sensitivity analysis in 
which hundreds or perhaps thousands of variations on baseline capital market assump -
tions lead to an equal number of mean–variance optimization frontiers based on the 
Monte Carlo–generated capital market assumptions. These intermediate frontiers are 
referred to as simulated frontiers. The resulting asset allocations, or portfolio weights, 
from these simulated frontiers are saved and averaged (using a variety of methods). To draw the resampled frontier, the averaged asset allocations are coupled with the starting capital market assumptions.
To illustrate how resampling can be used with other techniques, we conducted a 
resampled mean–variance optimization using the Black–Litterman returns from Exhibit 
10, above. Exhibit 16 provides the asset allocation area graph from this optimization. Notice that the resulting asset allocations are smoother than in any of the previous asset allocation area graphs. Additionally, relative to Exhibit 15, based on the same inputs, the smallest allocations have increased in size while the largest allocations have decreased somewhat.
13 The c urrent embodiments of resampling grew out of the work of Jobson and Korkie (1980, 1981); Jorion 
(1992); DiBartolomeo (1993); and Michaud (1998).

The asset allocations from resampling as depicted in Exhibit 16 are appealing. Criticisms 
include the following: (1) Some frontiers have concave “bumps” where expected 
return decreases as expected risk increases; (2) the “riskier” asset allocations are 
over-diversified; (3) the asset allocations inherit the estimation errors in the original inputs; and (4) the approach lacks a foundation in theory.

Other Non-Normal Optimization Approaches
From our list of shortcomings/criticisms of mean–variance optimization, the third is that investor preferences may go beyond the first two moments (mean and variance) of a portfolio’s return distribution. The third and fourth moments are, respectively, skewness and kurtosis. Skewness measures the degree to which return distributions are asymmetrical, and kurtosis measures the thickness of the distributions’ tails (i.e., how frequently extreme events occur). A normal distribution is fully explained by 
the first two moments because the skewness and (excess) kurtosis of the normal 
distribution are both zero.
Returning to the discussion of Equation 1, the mean–variance optimization pro-
gram involves maximizing expected utility, which is equal to expected return minus a 
penalty for risk, where risk is measured as variance (standard deviation). Unfortunately, 
variance or standard deviation is an incomplete measure of risk when returns are not normally distributed. By studying historical return distributions for the major asset classes and comparing those historical distributions to normal distributions, one will quickly see that, historically, asset class returns are not normally distributed. In fact, empirically extreme returns seem to occur approximately 10 times more often than the normal distribution would suggest. Coupling this finding with the asymmetrical risk preferences observed in investors—whereby the pain of a loss is approximately

twice as significant as the joy from an equivalent gain (according to Prospect the-
ory)—has led to more complex utility functions and optimizers that expressly account 
for non-normal returns and asymmetric risk preference.15 A number of variations 
of these more sophisticated optimization techniques have been put forth, making 
them challenging to cover. In general, most of them consider the non-normal return distribution characteristics and use a more sophisticated definition of risk, such as conditional value-at-risk. We view these as important advancements in the toolkit available to practitioners.

Long-Term versus Short-Term Inputs
Strategic asset allocation is often described as “long term, ” while tactical asset allo -
cation involves short-term movements away from the strategic asset allocation. 
In this context, “long term” is often defined as 10 or perhaps 20 or more years, 
yet in practice, very few asset allocators revisit their strategic asset allocation this infrequently. Many asset allocators update their strategic asset allocation 
annually, which makes it a bit more challenging to distinguish between strategic 
and tactical asset allocations. This frequent revisiting of the asset allocation policy brings up important questions about the time horizon associated with 
the inputs. In general, long-term (10-plus-year) capital market assumptions that 
ignore current market conditions, such as valuation levels, the business cycle, and interest rates, are often thought of as unconditional inputs. Unconditional inputs focus on the average capital market assumptions over the 10-plus-year 
time horizon. In contrast, shorter-term capital market assumptions that explicitly 
attempt to incorporate current market conditions (i.e., that are “conditioned” on them) are conditional inputs. For example, a practitioner who believes that the market is overvalued and that as a result we are entering a period of low returns, high volatility, and high correlations might prefer to use conditional inputs that reflect these beliefs.

C. Cr itique the efficient asset mixes represented in Panel A.
Solution to 1A:
For a risk-neutral investor, the optimal asset allocation is 100% invested 
in emerging market equities. For a risk-neutral investor (λ = 0), expected utility is simply equal to expected return. The efficient asset allocation that maximizes expected return is the one with the highest level of volatility, as indicated on the x-axis. Panel A shows that that asset allocation consists entirely of emerging market equities.
Solution to 1B:
The weights of NUSD as the efficient frontier moves from its minimum to its maximum risk point suggest NUSD’s investment characteristics. This asset class is neither the lowest-volatility asset (which can be inferred to be cash) nor the highest-volatility asset (which is emerging market equity). At the point of the peak of NUSD, when the weight in NUSD is about to begin its decline in higher-risk efficient portfolios, US bonds drop out of the effi-cient frontier. Further, NUSD leaves the efficient frontier portfolio at a point at which US small cap reaches its highest weight. These observations suggest that NUSD provided diversification benefits in portfolios including US bonds—a relatively low correlation with US bonds can be inferred—that are lost at this point on the efficient frontier. Beyond a volatility level of 20.3%, representing a corner portfolio, NUSD drops out of the efficient frontier.
Solution to 1C:
Of the nine asset classes in the investor’s defined opportunity set, five at most are represented by portfolios on the efficient frontier. Thus, a criticism of the efficient frontier associated with Panel A is that the efficient portfolios are highly concentrated in a subset of the available asset classes, which likely reflects the input sensitivity of MVO.
2.
 Com
pare the asset allocations shown in Panel A with the corresponding 
asset allocations shown in Panel B. (Include a comparison of the panels at the level of risk indicated by the line in Panel B.)
Solution to 2:
The efficient asset mixes in Panels A and B cover a similar risk range: The risk levels of the two minimum-variance portfolios are similar, and the risk levels of the two maximum-return portfolios are similar. Over most of the range of volatility, however, the efficient frontier associated with Panel B is better diversified. For example, at the line in Panel B, representing a moder-ate level of volatility likely relevant to many investors, the efficient portfolio contains nine asset classes rather than four, as in Panel A. At that point, for example, the allocation to fixed income is spread over US bonds, non-US bonds, and US TIPS in Panel B, as opposed to just US bonds in Panel A.

Learning Module 4  Principles of A sset Allocation 228
Solution to 3A:
To achieve the better-diversified efficient frontier shown in Panel B, several 
methods might have been used, including reverse optimization, the Black–Litterman model, and constrained asset class weights.
Solution to 3B:
Reverse optimization and the Black–Litterman model address the issue of MVO’s sensitivity to small differences in expected return estimates by anchoring expected returns to those implied by the asset class weights of a proxy for the global market portfolio. The Black–Litterman framework pro-vides a disciplined way to tilt the expected return inputs in the direction of the investor’s own views. These approaches address the problem by improv-ing the balance between risk and return that is implicit in the inputs.
A very direct approach to the problem can be taken by placing constraints 
on weights in the optimization to force an asset class to appear in a con-strained efficient frontier within some desired range of values. For example, non-US bonds did not appear in any efficient portfolio in Panel A. The investor could specify that the weight on non-US bonds be strictly posi-tive. Another approach would be to place a maximum on the weight in US bonds to make the optimizer spread the fixed-income allocation over other fixed-income assets besides US bonds.
ALLOCATING TO LESS LIQUID ASSET CLASSES
discuss asset class liquidity considerations in asset allocation
Large institutional investors have the ability to invest in less liquid asset classes, such as direct real estate, infrastructure, and private equity. These less liquid asset classes 
represent unique challenges to many of the common asset allocation techniques, such 
as mean–variance optimization.
For traditional, highly liquid asset classes, such as publicly listed equities and 
bonds, almost all of the major index providers have indexes that do an outstanding job of representing the performance characteristics of the asset class (and its various sub–asset classes). For example, over any reasonably long time period, the risk and 
return characteristics of a given asset class are nearly identical across the major global 
equity indexes and the correlations between the returns of the indexes are close to 1. 
Additionally, in most cases, there are passive, low-cost investment vehicles that allow 
investors to capture the performance of the asset class with very little tracking error.
CASH, THE RISK-FREE ASSET, AND LIQUIDITY NEEDS
The so called “risk-free asset” has a special and somewhat tricky spot in the world 
of finance. Asset allocators typically use indexes for either 30-day or 90-day government bills to represent the characteristics associated with holding cash, which they may or may not treat as the risk-free asset. The volatility associated 
with these total return indexes is extremely low, but it isn’t zero. An alternative to 
using a cash index as a proxy for the risk-free asset is to use a government bond with a duration/maturity that matches the time horizon of the investor. Some 7

Allocating to Less Liquid Asset Classes 229
asset allocators like to include cash or another asset that could be considered a 
risk-free asset in the optimization and to allow the optimizer to determine how to mix it with the other asset classes included in the optimization. Other asset allocators prefer to exclude the risk-free asset from the optimization and allow real-world needs, such as liquidity needs, to determine how much to allocate to cash-like assets.
Illiquid assets may offer an expected return premium as compensation for illiquid -
ity as well as diversification benefits. Determining an appropriate allocation to these assets is associated with various challenges, however. Common illiquid asset classes 
cannot be readily diversified to eliminate idiosyncratic risk, so representing an overall 
asset class performance is problematic. Furthermore, for less liquid asset classes, such 
as direct real estate, infrastructure, and private equity, there are, in general, far fewer indexes that attempt to represent aggregate performance. If one were to compare the performance characteristics of multiple indexes representing one of these less liquid asset classes, there would be noticeable risk and return differences, suggesting that it is difficult to accurately measure the risk and return characteristics of these asset classes. Also, due to the illiquid nature of the constituents that make up these asset 
classes, it is widely believed that the indexes don’t accurately reflect their true volatility. 
In contrast to the more traditional, highly liquid asset classes, there are no low-cost passive investment vehicles that would allow investors to closely track the aggregate performance of these less liquid asset classes.
Thus, the problem is twofold: (1) Due to the lack of accurate indexes, it is more 
challenging to make capital market assumptions for these less liquid asset classes, and (2) even if there were accurate indexes, there are no low-cost passive investment vehicles to track them.
Compounding the asset allocator’s dilemma is the fact that the risk and return 
characteristics associated with actual investment vehicles, such as direct real estate 
funds, infrastructure funds, and private equity funds, are typically significantly differ -
ent from the characteristics of the asset classes themselves. For example, the private equity “asset class” should represent the risk and return characteristics of owning all private equity, just as the MSCI All Country World Index represents the risk and return characteristics of owning all public equity. Purchasing the exchange-traded 
fund (ETF) that tracks the MSCI All Country World Index completely diversifies 
public company-specific risk. This scenario is in direct contrast to the typical private 
equity fund, in which the risk and return characteristics are often dominated by 
company-specific (idiosyncratic) risk.
In addressing asset allocation involving less liquid asset classes, practical options 
include the following:
1.
 E
xclude less liquid asset classes (direct real estate, infrastructure, and pri-
vate equity) from the asset allocation decision and then consider real estate funds, infrastructure funds, and private equity funds as potential implemen-tation vehicles when fulfilling the target strategic asset allocation.
2.
 Inc
lude less liquid asset classes in the asset allocation decision and attempt 
to model the inputs to represent the specific risk characteristics associated with the likely implementation vehicles.
3.
 Inc
lude less liquid asset classes in the asset allocation decision and attempt 
to model the inputs to represent the highly diversified characteristics associ-ated with the true asset classes.
Related to this last option, some practitioners use listed real estate indexes, listed 
infrastructure, and public equity indexes that are deemed to have characteristics 
similar to their private equity counterparts to help estimate the risk of the less liquid asset classes and their correlation with the other asset classes in the opportunity set.

Learning Module 4  Principles of A sset Allocation 230
It should be noted that the use of listed alternative indexes often violates the recom-
mendation that asset classes be mutually exclusive—the securities in these indexes 
are likely also included in indexes representing other asset classes—and thus typically 
results in higher correlations among different asset classes, which has the negative impact of increasing input sensitivity in most optimization settings.
For investors who do not have access to direct real estate funds, infrastructure 
funds, and private equity funds—for example, small investors—the most common approach is to use one of the indexes based on listed equities to represent the asset class and then to implement the target allocation with a fund that invests similarly. Thus global REITs might be used to represent (approximately) global real estate.
RISK BUDGETING
explain absolute and relative risk budgets and their use in determining and implementing an asset allocation
describe how client needs and preferences regarding investment risks can be incorporated into asset allocation
[A] risk budget is simply a particular allocation of portfolio risk. An optimal 
risk budget is simply the allocation of risk such that the first order of con-ditions for portfolio optimization are satisfied. The risk budgeting process is the process of finding an optimal risk budget.
Kurt Winkelmann (2003, p. 173)
As this quote from Kurt Winkelmann suggests, there are three aspects to risk budgeting:
 ■The risk budget identifies the total amount of risk and allocates the risk to a portfolio’s constituent parts.
 ■An optimal risk budget allocates risk efficiently.
 ■The process of finding the optimal risk budget is risk budgeting.
Although its name suggests that risk budgeting is all about risk, risk budgeting is 
really using risk in relation to seeking return. The goal of risk budgeting is to maximize 
return per unit of risk—whether overall market risk in an asset allocation setting or active risk in an asset allocation implementation setting.
The ability to determine a position’s marginal contribution to portfolio risk is a 
powerful tool that helps one to better understand the sources of risk. The marginal 
contribution to a type of risk is the partial derivative of the risk in question (total risk, 
active risk, or residual risk) with respect to the applicable type of portfolio holding 
(asset allocation holdings, active holdings, or residual holdings). Knowing a position’s 
marginal contribution to risk allows one to (1) approximate the change in portfolio risk (total risk, active risk, or residual risk) due to a change in an individual holding, 
(2) determine which positions are optimal, and (3) create a risk budget. Risk-budgeting 
tools assist in the optimal use of risk in the pursuit of return.
Exhibit 19 contains risk-budgeting information for the Sharpe ratio–maximizing 
asset allocation from our original UK example. The betas are from Exhibit 12. The marginal contribution to total risk (MCTR) identifies the rate at which risk would change with a small (or marginal) change in the current weights. For asset class i , it is 
calculated as MCTRi = (Beta of asset class i  with respect to portfolio)(Portfolio return 
volatility). The absolute contribution to total risk (ACTR) for an asset class measures 8

Risk Budgeting 231
how much it contributes to portfolio return volatility and can be calculated as the 
weight of the asset class in the portfolio times its marginal contribution to total risk: 
ACTRi = (Weighti)(MCTRi). Critically, beta takes account not only of the asset’s own 
volatility but also of the asset’s correlations with other portfolio assets.
The sum of the ACTR in Exhibit 19 is approximately 10.88%, which is equal to the 
expected standard deviation of this asset allocation mix. Dividing each ACTR by the total risk of 10.88% gives the percentage of total risk that each position contributes. Finally, an asset allocation is optimal from a risk-budgeting perspective when the ratio of excess return (over the risk-free rate) to MCTR is the same for all assets and matches the Sharpe ratio of the tangency portfolio. So in this case, which is based on reverse-optimized returns, we have an optimal risk budget.

Risk Budgeting in Asset Allocation
1. D escribe the objective of risk budgeting in asset allocation.
Solution:
The objective of risk budgeting in asset allocation is to use risk efficiently 
in the pursuit of return. A risk budget specifies the total amount of risk and how much of that risk should be budgeted for each allocation.
2.
 Consider two a
sset classes, A and B. Asset class A has two times the weight 
of B in the portfolio. Under what condition would B have a larger ACTR than A?
Solution:
Because ACTRi = (Weighti)(Beta with respect to portfolio)i(Portfolio return 
volatility), the beta of B would have to be more than twice as large as the beta of A for B to contribute more to portfolio risk than A.
3.
 When i
s an asset allocation optimal from a risk-budgeting perspective?
Solution:
An asset allocation is optimal when the ratio of excess return (over the risk-free rate) to MCTR is the same for all assets.
FACTOR-BASED ASSET ALLOCATION
describe the use of investment factors in constructing and analyzing an asset allocation
Until now, we have primarily focused on the mechanics of asset allocation optimiza-tion as applied to an opportunity set consisting of traditional, non-overlapping asset classes. An alternative approach used by some practitioners is to move away from an 
opportunity set of asset classes to an opportunity set consisting of investment factors .
In factor-based asset allocation, the factors in question are typically similar to the 
fundamental (or structural) factors in widely used multi-factor investment models. 
Factors are typically based on observed market premiums and anomalies. In addition 
to the all-important market (equity) exposure, typical factors used in asset allocation include size, valuation, momentum, liquidity, duration (term), credit, and volatility. Most of these factors were identified as return drivers that help to explain returns that were not explained by the CAPM. These factors can be constructed in a number of different ways, but with the exception of the market factor, typically, the factor represents what is referred to as a zero (dollar) investment, or self-financing invest -
ment, in which the underperforming attribute is sold short to finance an offsetting long position in the better-performing attribute. For example, the size factor is the 
combined return from shorting large-cap stocks and going long small-cap stocks 
(Size factor return = Small-cap stock return − Large-cap stock return). Of course, if large-cap stocks outperform small-cap stocks, the realized size return would be 9

Factor-Based Asset Allocation 233
negative. Constructing factors in this manner removes most market exposure from 
the factors (because of the short positions that offset long positions); as a result, the factors generally have low correlations with the market and with one another.
We next present an example of a factor-based asset allocation optimization. 
Exhibit 20 shows the list of factors, how they were specified, and their historical 
returns and standard deviations (in excess of the risk-free rate as proxied by the 
return on three-month Treasury bills). The exhibit also includes historical statistics for three-month Treasury bills.
Thus far, our optimization examples have taken place in “total return space, ” where 
the expected return of each asset has equaled the expected return of the risk-free asset 
plus the amount of expected return in excess of the risk-free rate. In order to stay in this familiar total return space when optimizing with risk factors, the factor return needs to include the return on the assumed collateral (in this example, cash, repre-sented by three-month Treasury bills). This adjustment is also needed if one plans to 
include both risk factors and some traditional asset classes in the same optimization, so 
that the inputs for the risk factors and traditional asset classes are similarly specified. Alternatively, one could move in the opposite direction, subtracting the return of the three-month Treasury bills from asset class returns and then conducting the optimi-zation in excess-return space. One way to think about a self-financing allocation to a risk factor is that in order to invest in the risk factor, one must put up an equivalent amount of collateral that is invested in cash.

Because of space considerations, we have not included the full correlation matrix, but it is worth noting that the average pair-wise correlation of the risk factor–based opportunity set (in excess of the risk-free rate collateral return) is 0.31, whereas that of the asset class–based opportunity set is 0.57. Given the low pair-wise correlations of the risk factors, there has been some debate among practitioners around whether

it is better to optimize using asset classes or risk factors. The issue was clarified by 
Idzorek and Kowara (2013), who demonstrated that in a proper comparison, neither 
approach is inherently superior. To help illustrate risk factor optimization and to 
demonstrate that if the two opportunity sets are constructed with access to similar exposures, neither approach has an inherent advantage, we present two side-by-side optimizations. These optimizations are based on the data given in Exhibit 20.
Exhibit 21 contains the two efficient frontiers. As should be expected, given that 
the opportunity sets provide access to similar exposures, the two historical efficient frontiers are very similar. This result illustrates that when the same range of potential exposures is available in two opportunity sets, the risk and return possibilities are very similar.

ALLOCATIONS AND CHARACTERIZING THE LIABILITIES
describe and evaluate characteristics of liabilities that are relevant to 
asset allocation
discuss approaches to liability-relative asset allocation
Liability-relative asset allocation is aimed at the general issue of rendering decisions about asset allocation in conjunction with the investor’s liabilities. Liability-relative investors view assets as an inventory of capital, sometimes increased by additions, 
which is available to achieve goals and to pay future liabilities. What is the chance that 
an institution’s capital is sufficient to cover future cash flow liabilities? This type of 
question is critical for liability-relative asset allocation because many large institutional 
investors—for example, banks, insurance companies, and pension plans—possess legal 
liabilities and operate in regulated environments in which an institution’s inability to meet its liabilities with current capital has serious consequences. This concern gives 
rise to unique risk measures, such as the probability of meeting future cash flow 
requirements, and the restatement of traditional risk metrics, such as volatility, in relation to liabilities.
Liability-relative methods were developed in an institutional investor context, but 
these ideas have also been applied to individual investors. This section will focus on institutional investors. A later section addresses a thematically similar approach with behavioral finance roots—goals-based asset allocation.
Characterizing the Liabilities
To be soundly applied, liability-relative asset allocation requires an accurate under -
standing of the liabilities. A liability is a promise by one party to pay a counterparty 
based on a prior agreement. Liabilities may be fixed or contingent. When the amounts 
and timing of payments are fixed in advance by the terms of a contract, the liability is said to be fixed or non-contingent. A corporate bond with a fixed coupon rate is an example.
In many cases relevant to asset allocation, payments depend upon future, uncertain 
events. In such cases, the liability is a contingent liability.17 An important example 
involves the liabilities of a defined benefit (DB) pension plan. The plan sponsor has a legal commitment to pay the beneficiaries of the plan during their retirement years. 
However, the exact dates of the payments depend on the employees’ retirement 
dates, longevity, and cash payout rules. Insurance companies’ liabilities—created by the sale of insurance policies—are also contingent liabilities: The insurance company promises to pay its policyholders a specified amount contingent on the occurrence of a predefined event.
We distinguish legal liabilities from cash payments that are expected to be made in 
the future and are essential to the mission of an institution but are not legal liabilities. 
We call these quasi-liabilities. The endowment of a university can fit this category because, in many cases, the endowment contributes a major part of the university’s operating budget. The endowment assures its stakeholders that it will continue to 
17 Not e that the term “contingent liability” has a specific definition in accounting. We are using the term more broadly here.10

support its essential activities through spending from the endowment capital, and 
failure to provide such support will often lead to changes in how the endowment is managed. Accordingly, the asset allocation decisions are made in conjunction with the university’s spending rules and policies. Asset allocation is just one portion of the investment problem. Although we do not explicitly discuss them here, as sug-gested in Sections 2–9, the spending needs of an individual represent another type of quasi-liability. Exhibit 23 summarizes the characteristics of liabilities that can affect asset allocation.

 Re
gulations affecting liability cash flow calculations
The above liability characteristics are relevant to liability-relative asset allocation 
in various ways. For example, they affect the choice of appropriate discount rate(s) to establish the present value of the liabilities and thus the degree to which assets are adequate in relation to those liabilities. Liability characteristics determine the com-position of the liability-matching portfolio and that portfolio’s basis risk with respect 
to the liabilities. (Basis risk in this context quantifies the degree of mismatch between 
the hedging portfolio and the liabilities.)
We will discuss the following case study in detail. It involves a frozen pension 
plan for LOWTECH, a hypothetical US company. The company has decided to close its defined benefit pension plan and switch to a defined contribution plan. The DB plan has the fixed liabilities (accumulated benefit obligations) shown in Exhibit 24.

In the Cash Outflow (Liability) column, the assumption is made that payments for 
a given year are made at the beginning of the year (in the exhibit, outflows have a positive sign). As of the beginning of 2015, the present value of these liabilities, given a 4% discount rate for high-quality corporate bonds (required in the United States by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which applies to private DB pension plans), is US$2.261 billion. The current market value of the assets is assumed to equal US$2.5 billion, for a surplus of US$0.239 billion. On the other hand, if the discount rate is 
equal to the long-term government bond rate at 2% (required before the 2006 US leg -
islation), the surplus becomes a deficit at −$0.539 billion. In many cases, regulations set the appropriate discount rates; these rates have an impact on the determination of surplus or deficit and thus on future contribution rules.
Like other institutions with legal liabilities, the LOWTECH company must analyze 
its legal future cash flows under its DB pension system and evaluate them in con-junction with the current market value of its assets on an annual basis. The following steps of the valuation exercise for a DB pension plan occur on a fixed annual date:

Approaches to Liability-Relative Asset Allocation: Surplus Optimization 239
 Surplus = Market value (assets) − Present value (liabilities). 
The surplus for the LOWTECH company is US$2.500 billion − US$2.261 billion 
= US$0.239 billion, given the 4% discount rate assumption.
The funding ratio is another significant measure: Funding ratio = Market value 
(assets)/Present value (liabilities). We say that an investor is fully funded if the inves-
tor’s funding ratio equals 1 (or the surplus is 0). A state of overfunding occurs when the funding ratio is greater than 1, and a state of underfunding takes place when the funding ratio is less than 1. Based on a discount rate of 4%, the funding ratio for 
LOWTECH = US$2.5 billion/US$2.261 billion = 1.1057, so that the company is about 
10.6% overfunded.
The surplus value and the funding ratio are highly dependent upon the discount 
rate assumption. For example, if the discount rate is equal to 2.0% (close to the 10-year 
US Treasury bond rate in early 2016), the surplus drops to −US$0.539 billion and the funding ratio equals 0.8226. The company’s status changes from overfunded to 
underfunded. The choice of discount rate is generally set by regulations and tradition. 
Rate assumptions are different across industries, countries, and domains. From the standpoint of economic theory, if the liability cash flows can be hedged perfectly by a set of market-priced assets, the discount rate can be determined by reference to the discount rate for the assets. For example, if the pension plan liabilities are fixed 
(without any uncertainty), the discount rate should be the risk-free rate with reference 
to the duration of the liability cash flows—for example, a five-year zero-coupon bond yield for a liability with a (modified) duration of 5. In other cases, it can be difficult to find a fully hedged portfolio because an ongoing DB pension plan’s liabilities will 
depend upon future economic growth and inflation, which are clearly uncertain. Even 
a frozen pension plan can possess uncertainty due to the changing longevity of the retirees over the long-term future.
APPROACHES TO LIABILITY-RELATIVE ASSET 
ALLOCATION: SURPLUS OPTIMIZATION
describe and evaluate characteristics of liabilities that are relevant to 
asset allocation
discuss approaches to liability-relative asset allocation
recommend and justify a liability-relative asset allocation
Various approaches to liability-relative asset allocation exist. These methods are influ -
enced by tradition, regulations, and the ability of the stakeholders to understand and extend portfolio models that come from the asset-only domain.
There are several guiding principles. The first is to gain an understanding of the 
make-up of the investor’s liabilities and especially the factors that affect the amount and timing of the cash outflows. Given this understanding, the present value of the liabilities is calculated, along with the surplus and funding ratio. These measures are 
used to track the results of ongoing investment and funding policies and for other tasks. 
Next come the decisions regarding the asset allocation taking account of the liabili-ties. There are a number of ways to proceed. We will discuss three major approaches:
 ■Surplus optimization. This approach involves applying mean–variance optimization (MVO) to an efficient frontier based on the volatility of the surplus (“surplus volatility, ” or “surplus risk”) as the measure of risk. Surplus 11

Learning Module 4  Principles of A sset Allocation 240
optimization is thus an extension of MVO based on asset volatility.18 
Depending on context, surplus risk may be stated in money or percentage 
terms (“surplus return volatility” is then another, more precise term for this measure).
 ■Hedging/return-seeking portfolios approach. This approach involves separat -
ing assets into two groups: a hedging portfolio and a return-seeking portfo-lio. The reading also refers to this as the two-portfolio approach. The con-cept of allocating assets to two distinct portfolios can be applied for various funding ratios, but the reading distinguishes as the basic approach the case in which there is a positive surplus available to allocate to the return-seeking portfolio.
 ■Integrated asset–liability approach. For some institutional investors, such as banks and insurance companies and long–short hedge funds, asset and liability decisions can be integrated and jointly optimized.
We cover these three approaches in turn.
Surplus Optimization
Surplus optimization involves adapting asset-only mean–variance optimization by 
substituting surplus return for asset return over any given time horizon. The quadratic 
optimization program involves choosing the asset allocation (mix) that maximizes expected surplus return net of a penalty for surplus return volatility at the chosen time horizon. The objective function is
   U  m  LR  = E   (   R  s,m   )     − 0.005λ  σ   2    (   R  s,m   )      (2)
wher
e 
  U  m  LR   is the surplus objective function’s expected value for a particular asset 
mix m; E(Rs,m) is the expected surplus return for asset mix m , with surplus return 
defined as (Change in asset value − Change in liability value)/(Initial asset value); 
and the parameter λ (lambda) indicates the investor’s risk aversion. The more risk averse the investor, the greater the penalty for surplus return volatility. Note that the change in liability value (liability return) measures the time value of money for the liabilities plus any expected changes in the discount rate and future cash flows over the planning horizon.
This surplus efficient frontier approach is a straightforward extension of the 
asset-only portfolio model. Surplus optimization assumes that the relationship between 
the value of liabilities and the value of assets can be approximated through a correla-tion coefficient. Surplus optimization exploits natural hedges that may exist between assets and liabilities as a result of their systematic risk characteristics.
The following steps describe the surplus optimization approach:
1.
 S
elect asset categories and determine the planning horizon. One year is 
often chosen for the planning exercise, although funding status analysis is 
based on an analysis of all cash flows.
2.
 E
stimate expected returns and volatilities for the asset categories and esti-
mate liability returns (expanded matrix).
3.
 D
etermine any constraints on the investment mix.
4.
 E
stimate the expanded correlation matrix (asset categories and liabilities) 
and the volatilities.19
18 Among t he papers that discuss the surplus optimization model are Leibowitz and Henriksson (1988); 
Mulvey (1989, 1994); Sharpe and Tint (1990); Elton and Gruber (1992).19

Exhibit 25 lists LOWTECH’s asset categories and current allocation for a one-year 
planning horizon. The current allocation for other asset categories, such as cash, 
is zero. LOWTECH has been following an asset-only approach but has decided to 
adopt a liability-relative approach. The company is exploring several liability-relative 
approaches. With respect to surplus optimization, the trustees want to maintain surplus 
return volatility at a level that tightly controls the risk that the plan will become under -
funded, and they would like to keep volatility of surplus below US$0.25 billion (10%).

The second step is to estimate future expected asset and liability returns, the expected 
present value of liabilities, and the volatility of both assets and PV(liabilities). The capital market projections can be made in several ways—based on historical data, 
economic analysis, or expert judgment, for example. The plan sponsor and its advisers 
are responsible for employing one or a blend of these approaches. Exhibit 26 shows 
the plan sponsor’s capital market assumptions over a three- to five-year horizon. Note 
the inclusion of the present value of liabilities in Exhibit 26.

Typically, in the third step, the investor imposes constraints on the composition of 
the asset mix, including policy and legal limits on the amount of capital invested in individual assets or asset categories (e.g., a constraint that an allocation to equities must not exceed 50%). In our example, we simply constrain portfolio weights to be non-negative and to sum to 1.
The fourth step is to estimate the correlation matrix and volatilities. We assume 
that the liabilities have the same expected returns and volatilities as US corporate bonds; thus, the expanded matrix has a column and a row for liabilities with values 
equal to the corporate bond values. For simplicity, the investor may employ historical 
performance. Exhibit 27 shows the correlation matrix of asset categories based on historical quarterly returns. Recall that we assume that liability returns (changes in liabilities) are driven by changes in the returns of US corporate bonds. An alternative approach is to deploy a set of underlying factors that drive the returns of the assets.

Factors include changes in nominal and real interest rates, changes in economic activ -
ity (such as employment levels), and risk premiums. This type of factor investment 
model can be applied in an asset-only or a liability-relative asset allocation context.

Exhibit 28 shows a surplus efficient frontier that results from the optimization program 
based on the inputs from Exhibit 26 and Exhibit 27. Surplus risk (i.e., volatility of sur -
plus) in money terms (US$ billions) is on the x -axis, and expected surplus in money 
terms (US$ billions) is on the y -axis. By presenting the efficient frontier in money 
terms, we can associate the level of risk with the level of plan surplus, US$0.329 billion. 
Like the asset-only efficient frontier, the surplus efficient frontier has a concave shape.

Current Mix 
The first observation is that the current mix in Exhibit 28 lies below the surplus 
efficient frontier and is thus suboptimal.20 We can attain the same expected total 
surplus as that of the current mix at a lower level of surplus volatility by choosing the 
portfolio on the efficient frontier at the current mix’s level of expected total surplus. Another observation is that by uncovering the implications of asset mixes for surplus 
and surplus volatility, this approach allows the deliberate choice of an asset allocation 
in terms of the tolerable level of risk in relation to liabilities. It may be the case, for example, that neither the surplus volatility of the current mix nor that of the efficient 
mix with equal expected surplus is the appropriate level of surplus risk for the pension.
The surplus efficient frontier in Exhibit 28 shows efficient reward–risk combina-
tions but does not indicate the asset class composition of the combinations. Exhibit 29 shows the asset class weights for surplus efficient portfolios.
20 The c urrent mix can also be shown to lie below the asset-only mean–variance frontier.

Approaches to Liability-Relative Asset Allocation: Surplus Optimization 245
The asset mixes are very different on the conservative side of the two frontiers. The 
most conservative mix for the surplus efficient frontier (in Exhibit 29) consists mostly 
of the US corporate bond index (the hedging asset) because it results in the lowest 
volatility of surplus over the one-year horizon. Bonds are positively correlated with changes in the present value of the frozen liability cash flows (because the liabilities 
indicate negative cash flows). In contrast, the most conservative mix for the asset-only 
efficient frontier (in Exhibit 30) consists chiefly of cash. As long as there is a hedging 
asset and adequate asset value, the investor can achieve a very low volatility of surplus, 
and for conservative investors, the asset value at the horizon will be uncertain but the 
surplus will be constant (or as constant as possible).
The two asset mixes (asset-only and surplus) become similar as the degree of risk 
aversion decreases, and they are identical for the most aggressive portfolio (private equity). Bonds disappear from the frontier about halfway between the most conser -
vative and the most aggressive mixes, as shown in Exhibit 29 and Exhibit 30.
To summarize, the current asset mix is moderately aggressive and below the sur -
plus efficient frontier. Thus, a mean–variance improvement is possible: either higher 
expected surplus with the same surplus risk or lower surplus risk for the same expected 
surplus. The current portfolio is also poorly hedged with regard to surplus volatility; the hedging asset (long bonds in this case) has a low commitment.
The LOWTECH plan has been frozen, and the investment committee is inter -
ested in lowering the volatility of the surplus. Accordingly, it seems appropriate to choose an asset allocation toward the left-hand side of the surplus efficient frontier. For instance, a surplus efficient portfolio with about 60% bonds and the remainder in other assets (as can be approximately identified from Exhibit 29) will drop surplus volatility by about 50%.
In the end, the investment committee for the plan sponsor and its advisers and 
stakeholders are responsible for rendering the best decision, taking into account all of 
the above considerations. And as always, the recommendations of a portfolio-modeling 
exercise are only as good as the input data and assumptions.
MUL TI-PERIOD PORTFOLIO MODELS
The traditional mean–variance model assumes that the investor follows a buy-and-hold strategy over the planning horizon. Thus, the portfolio is not rebal-anced at intermediate dates. A portfolio investment model requires multiple time periods if rebalancing decisions are to be directly incorporated into the 
model. Mulvey, Pauling, and Madey (2003) discuss the pros and cons of building 
and implementing multi-period portfolio models. Applicable to both asset-only 
and liability-relative asset allocation, multi-period portfolio models are more 
comprehensive than single-period models but are more complex to implement. 
These models are generally implemented by means of the integrated asset–lia-bility methods discussed in Section 11.

EXAMPLE 6
Surplus Optimization
1. E xplain how surplus optimization solutions differ from mean–variance 
optimizations based on asset class risk alone.
Solution:
The surplus optimization model considers the impact of asset decisions 
on the (Market value of assets − Present value of liabilities) at the planning horizon.
2.
 Wha
t is a liability return?
Solution:
Liability returns measure the time value of money for the liabilities plus any expected changes in the discount rate over the planning horizon.
3.
 Com
pare the composition of a surplus optimal portfolio at two points on 
the surplus efficient frontier. In particular, take one point at the lower left of the surplus frontier (surplus return = US$0.26 billion) and the other point higher on the surplus efficient frontier (surplus return = US$0.32 billion). Refer to Exhibit 29. Explain the observed relationship in terms of the use of corporate bonds as the hedging asset for the liabilities.
Solution:
Whereas the portfolio at the US$0.26 billion surplus return point on the effi-cient frontier has a substantial position in corporate bonds, the efficient mix with US$0.32 billion surplus return does not include them. The observed relationship that the allocation to corporate bonds declines with increasing surplus return can be explained by the positive correlation of bond price with the present value of liabilities. The hedging asset (corporate bonds) is employed to a greater degree at the low end of the surplus efficient frontier.

Approaches to Liability-Relative Asset Allocation 247
Hedging/Return-Seeking Portfolio Approach 
In this approach, the liability-relative asset allocation task is divided into two parts. 
We distinguish as “basic” the two-portfolio approach in the case in which there is a 
surplus available to allocate to a return-seeking portfolio and as “variants” the approach 
as applied when there is not a positive surplus. In the basic case, the first part of the asset allocation task consists of hedging the liabilities through a hedging portfolio. In the second part, the surplus (or some part of it) is allocated to a return-seeking 
portfolio, which can be managed independently of the hedging portfolio (for example, 
using mean–variance optimization or another method). An essential issue involves the 
composition of the hedging portfolio. In some cases, such as the LOWTECH frozen DB pension plan, the hedging portfolio is straightforward to identify. The designated 
cash flows can be hedged via cash flow matching, duration matching, or immunization 
(as explained in the fixed-income readings). This hedge will support the future cash flows with little or no risk.
In LOWTECH’s application of the basic two-portfolio approach, the small sur -
plus causes the pension plan to invest most of its capital in the hedging portfolio. The hedging portfolio can be approximated by the long-bond indexed investment as a first cut. Thus, given a 4% discount rate, US$2.261 billion is placed in long bonds. The remaining US$0.239 billion is invested in a portfolio of higher expected return assets, such as stocks, real estate, and hedge funds. This approach guarantees that the capital is adequate to pay future liabilities, as long as the hedging portfolio does not experience defaults.
Note that if the discount rate were 2% rather than 4%, the pension plan would be 
underfunded even if all assets were placed in a hedging portfolio. In such a case, the pension plan sponsor would either develop a strategy to increase the funding ratio so that the liabilities would be eventually paid or apply a variant of the two-portfolio approach. An underfunded plan will require higher contributions from the sponsor than a plan that is fully funded or overfunded.
The basic two-portfolio approach is most appropriate for conservative investors, 
such as insurance companies, and for overfunded pension plans that wish to reduce or eliminate the risk of not being able to pay future liabilities.
Several variants of the two-portfolio approach are possible. These include a partial 
hedge, whereby capital allocated to the hedging portfolio is reduced in order to gen-erate higher expected returns, and dynamic versions whereby the investor increases the allotment to the hedging portfolio as the funding ratio increases. The specifica-tion of this allotment is often referred to as the liability glide path. These variants do not hedge the liabilities to the full extent possible given the assets and thus are less conservative than the basic approach discussed above. Still, there can be benefits to a partial hedge when the sponsor is able to increase contributions if the funding ratio does not increase in the future to 1 or above.
In the following discussion, we focus on determining the hedging portfolio.
Forming the Hedging Portfolio
The hedging portfolio must include assets whose returns are driven by the same fac -
tor(s) that drive the returns of the liabilities. Otherwise, even if the assets and liabilities 
start with equal values, the assets and liabilities will likely become inconsistent over 
time. One example involves promises (cash outflows) that are dependent upon future 
inflation. The hedging portfolio in this situation would often include index-linked 
(inflation-linked) Treasury bonds, again cash matched to the liabilities or immunized 
to the degree possible.

If there is an active market for the hedging portfolio (securities) in question, the 
present value of future cash flows is equal to a market value of the assets contained 
in the hedging portfolio. In this case, the date of valuation for the assets must be the same as the date of valuation for the liabilities. Absent market values, some form of appraised value is used.
The task of forming the hedging portfolio is complicated by the discount rate 
assumption and by the need to identify assets that are driven by the same factors that 
affect the liabilities. For example, if the discount rate is set by reference to a marketable 
instrument, such as the long government bond index, but the liability cash flows are driven by a factor such as inflation, the hedging task may require the use of instru-ments beyond nominal bonds (perhaps multiple instruments, such as interest rate swaps, inflation-linked bonds, and real assets). And in many applications, the hedge cannot be fully accomplished due to the nature of the driving factors (e.g., if they are non-marketable factors, such as economic growth).
If the uncertainties in the cash flows are related to non-market factors, such as 
future salary increases, the discount rate will depend upon regulations and tradition. 
Clearly, high discount rates lead to high funding ratios and in most cases require lower 
contributions from the sponsoring organization (at least in the short run). Conversely, 
lower discount rates give rise to lower funding ratios and thereby higher contributions. 
In the former case, investors with high discount rates will need to generate higher asset 
returns to achieve their promises if the pension plan sponsor wishes to avoid future contributions. A more conservative route is to designate a lower discount rate, as is the case in much of Europe and Asia. In all cases, it is the regulator’s responsibility to set the guidelines, rules, and penalties involved in determining contribution policy.
Several issues complicate the valuation of liability cash flows. In many situations, 
investors must satisfy their promises without being able to go to a market and pur -
chase a security with positive cash flows equal in magnitude to the liability cash flows.
At times, uncertain liabilities can be made more certain through the law of large 
numbers. For example, life insurance companies promise to pay beneficiaries when a policyholder dies. The life insurance company can minimize the risk of unexpected losses by insuring large numbers of individuals. Then, valuation of liabilities will use present value of expected cash flows based on a low (or even zero) risk premium in the discount rate. The field of application of the law of large numbers can be limited. For example, averages do not eliminate longevity risk.
Limitations
The basic two-portfolio approach cannot be directly applied under several circum-
stances. First, if the funding ratio is less than 1, the investor cannot create a fully hedging portfolio unless there is a sufficiently large positive cash flow (contribution). In this case, the sponsor might increase contributions enough to generate a positive surplus. As an alternative, there are conditional strategies that might help improve the investor’s funding ratio, such as the glide path rules.
22
A second barrier occurs when a true hedging portfolio is unavailable. An example 
involves losses due to weather-related causes, such as hurricanes or earthquakes. In these cases, the investor might be able to partially hedge the portfolio with instru-
ments that share some of the same risks. The investor has “basis risk” when imperfect 
hedges are employed. (As an aside, the investor might be able to set up a contract with 
someone who, for a fee, will take on the liability risk that cannot be hedged. Insurance 
contracts have this defining characteristic.)

EXAMPLE 7
The Hedging/Return-Seeking Portfolios Approach
1. Com pare how surplus optimization and the hedging/return-seeking portfo-
lio approach take account of liabilities.
Solution:
The surplus optimization approach links assets and the present value of 
liabilities through a correlation coefficient. The two-portfolio model does not require this input. Surplus optimization considers the asset allocation problem in one step; the hedging/return-seeking portfolio approach divides asset allocation into two steps.
2.
 H
ow does funding status affect the use of the basic hedging/return-seeking 
portfolio approach?
Solution:
Implementation of the basic two-portfolio approach depends on having an overfunded plan. A variant of the two-portfolio approach might be applied, however. Surplus optimization does not require an overfunded status. Both approaches address the present value of liabilities, but in different ways.
Integrated Asset–Liability Approach
The previous two approaches are most appropriate when asset allocation decisions are made after, and relatively independently of, decisions regarding the portfolio of 
liabilities. However, there are numerous applications of the liability-relative perspective 
in which the institution must render significant decisions regarding the composition 
of its liabilities in conjunction with the asset allocation. Banks, long–short hedge funds 
(for which short positions constitute liabilities), insurance companies, and re-insurance 
companies routinely fall into this situation. Within this category, the liability-relative 
approaches have several names, including asset–liability management (ALM) for 
banks and some other investors and dynamic financial analysis (DFA) for insurance companies. These approaches are often implemented in the context of multi-period models. Using the following two cases, we review the major issues.
INTEGRATED ASSET–LIABILITY APPROACH FOR PROPERTY/CASUAL TY INSURANCE COMPANIES
A property/casualty insurance company must make asset investment decisions 
in conjunction with business decisions about the portfolio of insured properties, 
its liabilities. To that end, asset and liability decisions are frequently integrated in 
an enterprise risk management system. In fact, the liability portfolio is essential 
to the company’s long-term viability. For example, a particular property/casualty 
(PC) insurance company might engage (accept) liabilities for catastrophic risks 
such as earthquakes and hurricanes. In this case, the liabilities depend upon rare 
events and thus are most difficult to hedge against. Specialized firms calculate 
insured losses for a chosen set of properties for property/casualty insurance com -
panies, and these firms provide liability cash flows on a probabilistic (scenario) basis. In this way information is gathered about the probability of losses over 
the planning horizon and the estimated losses for each loss event. An important

Learning Module 4  Principles of A sset Allocation 250
issue involves the amount of capital needed to support the indicated liabilities. 
This issue is addressed by evaluating the tail risks, such as the 1% Value-at-Risk or Conditional-Value-at-Risk amount. To reduce this risk, there are major advantages to forming a diversified global portfolio of liabilities and rendering asset allocation decisions in conjunction with the liability portfolio decisions. The hedging portfolio in this case is not well defined. Therefore, it is difficult to hedge liabilities for a book of catastrophic risk policies. Liabilities might be addressed via customized products or by purchasing re-insurance. The assets and liabilities are integrated so that the worst-case events can be analyzed with regard to both sides of the balance sheet.
INTEGRATED ASSET–LIABILITY APPROACH FOR BANKS
Large global banks are often required to analyze their ability to withstand stress 
scenarios, in accordance with the Basel III framework. These institutions must 
be able to show that their current capital is adequate to withstand losses in their 
business units, such as asset trading, in conjunction with increases in liabilities. 
The chief risk officer evaluates these scenarios by means of integrated asset–liability approaches. The asset and liability decisions are linked in an enterprise manner. Both the portfolio of assets and the portfolio of liabilities have major impacts on the organization’s risk. Thus, decisions to take on new products or expand an existing product—thereby generating liabilities—must take into 
account the associated decisions on the asset side. The integrated asset–liability 
management system provides a mechanism for discovering the optimal mix of assets and liabilities (products). These applications often employ multi-period models via a set of projected scenarios.
Decisions about asset allocation will affect the amount of business available to 
a financial intermediary, such as a bank or insurance company. Similarly, decisions about the portfolio of liabilities and concentration risks will feed back to the asset allocation decisions. Accordingly, we can set up a linked portfolio model. In a similar fashion, the performance of the assets of an institution possessing quasi-liabilities, such as a university endowment, will affect the spending rules for the institution. We can reduce worst-case outcomes by adjusting spending during crash periods, for example. Portfolio models linked to liabilities can provide significant information, helping the institution make the best compromise decisions for both the assets and the liabilities under its control. The twin goals are to maximize the growth of surplus over time subject to constraints on worst-case and other risk measures relative to the institution’s surplus.
Comparing the Approaches
We have introduced three approaches for addressing asset allocation decisions in the context of liability issues; Exhibit 31 summarizes their characteristics. Each of these approaches has been applied in practice. The surplus optimization approach is a straightforward extension of the traditional (asset-only) mean–variance model. 
Surplus optimization demonstrates the importance of the hedging asset for risk-averse 
investors and provides choices for investors who are less risk averse in the asset mixes 
located on the middle and the right-hand side of the efficient frontier. The assump-tions are similar to those of the traditional Markowitz model, where the inputs are expected returns and a covariance matrix. Thus, the assets and liabilities are linked 
through correlation conditions. The second approach, separating assets into two 
buckets, has the advantage of simplicity. The basic approach is most appropriate for

Approaches to Liability-Relative Asset Allocation 251
conservative investors, such as life insurance companies, and for overfunded/fully 
funded institutional investors that can fully hedge their liabilities. Another advantage 
of this approach is a focus on the hedging portfolio and its composition. The hedging 
portfolio can be constructed using a factor model and then linked to the assets via the 
same factors. Unfortunately, underfunded investors do not have the luxury of fully 
hedging their liabilities and investing the surplus in the risky portion; they must apply 
variants of the two-portfolio approach. The third approach, integrating the liability 
portfolio with the asset portfolio, is the most comprehensive of the three. It requires a formal method for selecting liabilities and for linking the asset performance with changes in the liability values. This approach can be implemented in a factor-based model, linking the assets and liabilities to the underlying driving factors. It has the potential to improve the institution’s overall surplus. It does not require the linear correlation assumption and is capable of modeling transaction costs, turnover con-straints, and other real-world constraints. The capital required for this approach is often determined by reference to the output of integrated asset–liability systems in banks and property/casualty insurance and re-insurance companies.

Liability-Relative Asset Allocation: Major Approaches

they come due is or is not addressed by each of the major approaches to 
liability-relative asset allocation.
Solution:
Such issues are best addressed by means of multi-period integrated asset–li-ability models. Surplus optimization and the two-portfolio approach, being single-period models, have difficulty estimating the probability of meeting future obligations.

2. Wha t are the advantages of the three approaches for investors who are more 
interested in protecting the surplus than growing their assets? Assume that 
the investor has a positive surplus.
Solution:
The three liability-relative approaches are appropriate for conservative investors (investors who are more interested in protecting the surplus than growing their assets). All of the three approaches force investors to under-stand the nature of their liabilities. This type of information can help inform the decision-making process.
EXAMINING THE ROBUSTNESS OF ASSET 
ALLOCATION ALTERNATIVES
discuss approaches to liability-relative asset allocation
As part of a liability-relative asset allocation study, the institutional investor can 
evaluate performance over selected events and “simulated” historical time periods. 
Each of the selected events can be interpreted as a “what if” sensitivity analysis. For example, we might wish to consider the effect of a 100 bp increase in interest rates across all maturities—that is, a parallel shift in the yield curve. This event would have a significant impact on the value of government bonds, clearly. Also, there would be 
a corresponding positive impact on the present discounted value of liabilities that are 
discounted at the government bond rate. The effect on other liability-relative asset 
allocation elements is less direct, and assumptions must be made. Suppose, for exam -
ple, that the investor must discount at the high-quality corporate rate. In that case, we 
need to estimate the effect of changing government rates on corporate rates. These 
designated studies are part of the stress tests required by banking and other regulators.
Another type of event study is the construction of scenarios based on carefully 
selected historical time periods. For example, we might select late 2008 as a reference 
point. In such a scenario, we are interested in the changes in the economic factors and 
the associated changes in the values of the institution’s assets and liabilities. What would 
be the impact on our current (or projected) portfolio—assets and PV(liabilities)—if the conditions seen in late 2008 occurred again?
A more comprehensive method for examining robustness involves setting up a 
multi-stage simulation analysis. Here, we use scenarios to model uncertainty and 
replace decisions with “rules. ” The process begins with a set of scenarios for the 
underlying driving economic factors. Each scenario designates a path for the asset 
returns and the liability values at each stage of the planning horizon. The result is a set 
of probabilistic outcomes for the institutional investor’s asset portfolio and the cash 
flows for its liabilities. In such modeling, one must take care to be consistent between 
asset returns and corresponding liabilities within a scenario; for example, if interest 
rates are a common factor driving both asset performance and the PV (liabilities), the 
interest rate effects should be based on the same assumptions.
Through the scenario analysis, the probability of both good and bad outcomes 
can be estimated. For example, we can measure the probability that an institutional investor will make a capital contribution in the future. Exhibit 32 shows the decision structure for the simulation of an insurance company over several periods, including modeling of the company’s business strategy and the required capital rules.13

Factor Modeling in Liability-Relative Approaches 253
To evaluate robustness, we can apply the simulation system with different assump-
tions. For instance, if we change the expected return of US equities, what is the 
effect on the probability of meeting the liabilities over an extended horizon, such as 
10 years? This type of sensitivity analysis is routinely done in conjunction with the modeling exercise.

APPROACHES

an asset allocation
discuss approaches to liability-relative asset allocation
A factor-based approach for liability-relative asset allocation has gained interest and 
credibility for several reasons. First, in many applications, the liability cash flows 
are dependent on multiple uncertainties. The two primary macro factors are future economic conditions and inflation. Many pension payments to beneficiaries will be based on inflation and salary changes over the employees’ work span. A fully hedged portfolio cannot be constructed when the liabilities are impacted by these uncertain factors. Recall that a hedged portfolio can be constructed for a frozen plan with fixed liabilities. For ongoing pension schemes, the best that can be done is to add asset cat -
egories to the portfolio that are positively correlated with the underlying driving risk 
factors, such as inflation-linked bonds. A factor-based approach can be implemented 
with any of the three liability-relative asset allocation methods discussed above.14

1. Wha t types of sensitivity analysis can be evaluated with a multi-period ALM 
simulation system?
Solution:
To provide estimates of the probability of meeting future obligations and the 
distribution of outcomes, several types of sensitivity analysis are likely to be performed.
 ■For example, the expected returns could be increased or decreased to evaluate the impact on future contributions to the plan.
 ■Likewise, by analyzing historical events, the investor can estimate the size of losses during crash periods and make decisions about the best asset allocation to protect against these worst-case events. Multiple risk measures over time (temporal risk measures) can be readily included in a simulation system.
DEVELOPING GOALS-BASED ASSET ALLOCATIONS
recommend and justify an asset allocation using a goals-based approach
In this section, we review the concept of goals-based asset allocation, focusing first on 
the rationale behind this different approach and its investment implications. We then 
discuss the major elements of the process, illustrating them with specific, simplified examples when necessary. We conclude with a discussion of the applicability of the approach and its major shortcomings.
A goals-based asset allocation process disaggregates the investor’s portfolio into 
a number of sub-portfolios, each of which is designed to fund an individual goal (or “mental account”) with its own time horizon and required probability of success. The literature behind the development of this approach is very rich. Initially, goals-based wealth management was specifically proposed by a small group of practitioners,
23 
each of whom offered his own solution for taking into account the tendency of indi-viduals to classify money into non-fungible mental accounts. Shefrin and Statman (2000) developed the concept of the behavioral portfolio, which can be related to the Maslow (1943) hierarchy of needs. Das, Markowitz, Scheid, and Statman (2010, 2011) showed that traditional and behavioral finance could be viewed as equivalent if one were prepared to change the definition of risk from volatility of returns to the probability of not achieving a goal.
24 The essential point is that optimality requires

both a suitably structured portfolio that can meet the given need and  the correct 
capital allocation based on an appropriate discount rate, reflecting considerations of 
time horizon and the required probability of success.
Individuals have needs that are different from those of institutions. The most 
important difference is that individuals often have multiple goals, each with its own time horizon and its own “urgency, ” which can be expressed as a specific required probability of success. Exhibit 33 summarizes differences in institutional and indi-vidual investor definitions of goals. An individual’s goals are not necessarily mutually compatible in two senses: The investor may not be able to address them all given the financial assets available, and there may be internal contradictions among the goals. 
An alternative process using one set of overall investment objectives—and thus effec -
tively ignoring or “averaging” the different time horizons and required probabilities of success of individual goals—ostensibly loses the granular nature of client goals; as a result, the inherent complexities of the investment problem are less likely to be addressed fully. An approach that breaks the problem into sub-portfolios carries a higher chance of fully addressing an investor’s goals, although it may require several 
iterations to ensure that the investor’s portfolio is internally consistent and satisfactory.

a “Mathematical expectations” here means the weighted expected return of portfolio components.
The characteristics of individuals’ goals have three major implications for an invest -
ment process that attempts to address the characteristics directly:
 ■The overall portfolio needs to be divided into sub-portfolios to permit each goal to be addressed individually.
 ■Both taxable and tax-exempt investments are important.
 ■Probability- and horizon-adjusted expectations (called “minimum expec -
tations” in Exhibit 33) replace the typical use of mathematically expected average returns in determining the appropriate funding cost for the goal (or “discount rate” for future cash flows).
Compared with average return expectations—the median or average return antic -
ipated for a combination of assets that is appropriate to address a goal—minimum expectations reflect a more complex concept. Minimum expectations are defined as the minimum return expected to be earned over the given time horizon with a given minimum required probability of success.
To illustrate, assume that a portfolio associated with a goal has an expected return 
of 7% with 10% expected volatility and the investor has indicated that the goal is to be met over the next five years with at least 90% confidence. Over the next five years,

that portfolio is expected to produce returns of 35% with a volatility of 22.4%.25 In 
short, this portfolio is expected to experience an average compound return of only 
1.3% per year over five years with a probability of 90%; this result is quite a bit lower than the portfolio’s average 7% expected return (see Exhibit 34). Thus, rather than 
discounting expected cash outflows by 7% to compute the dollar amount needed 
to defease the goal over that five-year horizon, one must use a considerably lower discount rate and by implication reserve a higher level of capital to meet that goal. Under moderate simplifying assumptions, that computation is valid whether or not 
return and volatility numbers are pretax or after-tax. Exhibit 34 shows, for the case of 
a normal distribution of returns, a return level that is expected to be exceeded 90% of 
the time (the 40% of the probability that lies between the vertical lines plus the 50% to the right of the median).

The Goals-Based Asset Allocation Process
Investment advisers taking a goals-based approach to investing client assets may 
implement this approach in a variety of ways. Exhibit 35 illustrates the major elements 
of the goals-based asset allocation process described in this reading. Ostensibly, there 
are two fundamental parts to this process. The first centers on the creation of portfolio modules, while the second involves identifying client goals and matching each of these 
goals to the appropriate sub-portfolio of a suitable asset size.
25 The return is the product of the annual return times the number of years, while the volatility is the product of the annual volatility times the square root of the number of years (under the assumption of independently and identically distributed returns).

Review
Determining the lowest-cost funding for any given goal requires the formulation of 
an optimized portfolio that will be used to defease that goal optimally in the sense that risks are not taken for which the investor is not fairly compensated. Note that this process is most often generic and internal to the adviser and his or her firm. The adviser will typically not create a specific sub-portfolio for each goal of each client but rather will select, from a pre-established set, one of a few modules—or model portfolios—that best meet each goal.
26 As discussed above, adjusting the expected 
return on that portfolio to account for the time horizon and the required probability of success allows one to formulate the relevant discount rate which, when applied to the expected cash flows, will help determine the capital required at the outset. That capital will then be invested in the optimized portfolio asset allocation, where the balance will decline until the end of the horizon, when it runs out.
27 Note that the 
process is somewhat iterative because individual investors may describe a certain horizon as set when in fact they view it as “the next x  years, ” with the horizon rolling 
by one year every year. Note also that discounting needs based on probability- and 
26 S ee the next paragraph for a discussion of when it makes sense to create specific optimal sub-portfolios.
27 An im portant reason for the use of a declining-balance portfolio relates to the need for individuals and families to plan for the transfer of assets at death. In order for the income from assets to be used by an individual, these assets must be in the individual’s name, or at least in a structure of which he or she is a beneficiary. Such assets would then be a part of the estate of the individual. Using a declining-balance 
portfolio allows the individual to receive the income—and some of the principal liquidated every year—while 
still ensuring that the amount of assets kept in the individual’s name remains as low as appropriate given the individual’s goals. An exception to this scenario would be the case of families whose income needs are so modest in relation to total assets that there is no need to provide income in planning for generational transfers or families that have such large eventual philanthropic intentions that assets kept in some bene-ficiaries’ names are meant to be transferred to charity at death.

Learning Module 4  Principles of A sset Allocation 258
horizon-adjusted minimum expectations naturally means that these expectations will 
be exceeded under “normal circumstances. ” Thus, it is not unusual for the funding for 
a goal to seem excessive with the benefit of hindsight.
Although the great majority of advisers will likely create individual client portfo-
lios using model portfolios—precisely, pre-optimized modules—a greater degree of 
customization is possible. Such customization involves creating specific sub-portfolios 
for each goal of each client. Indeed, it is conceivable, and mathematically possible, 
to create an optimal sub-portfolio for each goal. In fact, in practice, one would often proceed in this way when dealing with complex situations and with clients who have highly differentiated needs and constraints.
28 The adviser may find it impossible to 
use pre-optimized modules if the investment constraints imposed by the client are incompatible with those used in the creation of the module set. These might include, 
for instance, geographical or credit emphases—or de-emphases—that conflict with the 
market portfolio concept. Other restrictions might concern base currency, the use of alternative strategies, or the acceptability of illiquid investments, for example. Thus, 
although it is feasible for advisers to create client-specific modules, this approach can 
become prohibitively expensive. In short, one would likely use standardized modules for most individuals, except for those whose situation is so complex as to require a fully customized approach.
Many multi-client advisers may prefer to create a set of “goal modules” whose 
purpose is, collectively, to cover a full range of capital market opportunities and, indi -
vidually, to represent a series of return–risk trade-offs that are sufficiently differentiated 
to offer adequate but not excessive choices to meet all the goals they expect their 
clients to express. These modules should therefore collectively appear to create a form 
of efficient frontier, though the frontier they depict in fact does not exist because the 
modules may well be based on substantially different sets of optimization constraints.
The two most significant differences from one module to the next, besides the 
implied return–risk trade-offs, are liquidity requirements and the eligibility of cer -
tain asset classes or strategies. Additionally, while intra–asset class allocation to 
individual sub–asset classes or strategies may typically be guided by the market 
portfolio for that asset class, one can conceive of instances where the selection of a specific sub–asset class or strategy is justified, even though the asset class per se may seem inappropriate. For instance, one might agree to hold high-yield bonds in an equity-dominated portfolio because of the equity risk factor exposure inherent in lower-credit fixed income. Conversely, the fixed-income market portfolio might be limited to investment-grade bonds and possibly the base-currency-hedged variant of non-domestic investment-grade bonds. We will return to the construction of these modules in Section 17.
Describing Client Goals
At this point, it is important to note that individual investors do not always consider 
all goals as being equal and similarly well-formulated in their own minds. Thus, while 
certain investors will have a well-thought-out set of goals—which may at times not be 
simultaneously achievable given the financial assets available—others will focus only on a few “urgent” goals and keep other requirements in the background.
Thus, a first step is to distinguish between goals for which anticipated cash flows 
are available—whether regularly or irregularly timed across the horizon or represented 
by a bullet payment at some future point—and those we call “labeled goals, ” for which 
details are considerably less precise. The term “labeled” here simply means that the individual has certain “investment features” in mind—such as minimal risk, capital 
28 Not e that such an approach, being more complex, is also costlier. It would therefore be more likely to be economically feasible for those advisory clients who also have the ability to pay a higher fee.

Developing Goals-Based Asset Allocations 259
preservation, purchasing power preservation, and long-term growth—but has not 
articulated the actual need that stands behind each label. The individual may already have mentally allocated some portion of his or her assets, in currency or percentage 
terms, to one or several of these labels. For cash flow–based goals,29 the time horizon 
over which the goal is to be met is usually not difficult to ascertain: It is either the 
period over which cash outflows are expected to be made or the point in time at which 
a bullet payment is expected. More complex, however, is the issue of the urgency of the goal and thus of the required minimum probability of success.
By working to preserve a human (as opposed to a technical) tone in the advisory 
conversations, the adviser can serve the client without forcing him or her to come up with a quantified probability of success. The adviser may start with the simple obser -
vation that there are two fundamental types of goals: those that one seeks to achieve and those whose consequences one seeks to avoid. Dividing the goals the investor 
seeks to achieve into “needs, wants, wishes, and dreams” provides the adviser with an 
initial sense of the urgency of each goal. A need typically must be met and so should command a 90%–99% probability of success, while at the other end of the spectrum, 
it is an unfortunate fact that we all live with unfulfilled dreams, whose required prob -
abilities of success probably fall below 60%. A parallel—and analogous—structure can 
be created to deal with goals one seeks to avoid:30 “nightmares, fears, worries, and 
concerns, ” with similar implications in terms of required probabilities of success. In 
short, while some discussion of probability level may well take place, it can be informed 
and guided by the use of commonly accepted everyday words that will ensure that the 
outcome is internally consistent. The adviser avoids the use of jargon, which many clients dislike, and yet is able to provide professional advice.
31
The simplest way to bring this concept to life is to work with a basic case study. 
Imagine a family, the Smiths, with financial assets of US$25 million. (For the sake of simplicity, we are assuming that they do not pay taxes and that all assets are owned in a single structure.) The parents are in their mid-fifties, and the household spends about US$500,000 a year. They expect that inflation will average about 2% per year for the foreseeable future. They express four important goals and are concerned that they may not be able to meet all of them:
1.
 The
y need  a 95% chance of being able to maintain their current expenditures 
over the next five years.
2.
 The
y want an 85% chance of being able to maintain their current expendi-
tures over the ensuing 25 years, which they see as a reasonable estimate of their joint life expectancy.
3.
 The
y need  a 90% chance of being able to transfer US$10 million to their 
children in 10 years.
4.
 The
y wish  to have a 75% chance to be able to create a family foundation, 
which they wish to fund with US$10 million in 20 years.
29 Not e that all cash flows do not have to be negative (i.e., outflows). One can easily imagine circumstances 
where certain future inflows are anticipated and yet are not seen, individually, as sufficient to meet the specified goal.30
 Alt
hough negative goals may sound surprising, they do exist and play a double role. First, when a 
negative goal is explicitly stated, it can be “replaced” by a specific positive goal: Avoiding the nightmare of running out of capital, for example, can be turned into the need to meet a certain expense budget. Second, negative goals serve as a useful feedback loop to check the internal consistency of the investor’s goal set.31
 Not
e that the adviser can also identify a series of “secondary” words to help determine whether a 
need, for instance, means that the required probability of success should be set at 99%, 95%, or 90%. An indispensable need could require a 99% probability of being met, while an urgent need might require only a 95% probability of success, and a serious need a 90% probability.

EXAMPLE 10
Understanding Client Goals
1. A c lient describes a desire to have a reserve of €2 million for business 
opportunities that may develop when he retires in five years. What are the 
important features of this goal?
Solution:
The time horizon is five years. Words such as “desire” in describing a goal, compared with expressions indicating “need, ” indicate that there is room for “error” in the event that capital markets are not supportive. The portfolio required to meet the goal described as a desire will likely be able to involve a riskier profile. One would want to verify this assumption by comparing the size of that goal compared with the total financial assets available to the client.
2.
 A 70-
year-old client discusses the need to be able to maintain her lifestyle 
for the balance of her life and wishes to leave US$3 million to be split among her three grandchildren at her death. What are the important features of this situation?
Solution:
The key takeaway is that although the two goals have the same time horizon, the two portfolios designed to defease them will have potentially significant-ly different risk profiles. The time horizon is approximately 20 years. The first goal relates to maintaining the client’s lifestyle and must be defeased with an appropriately structured portfolio. The second goal, relating to the wish to leave some money to grandchildren, will allow more room for risk taking.
CONSTRUCTING SUB-PORTFOLIOS AND THE 
OVERALL PORTFOLIO
recommend and justify an asset allocation using a goals-based 
approach
Having defined the needs of the investor in as much detail as possible, the next step in 
the process is to identify the amount of money that needs to be allocated to each goal 
and the asset allocation that will apply to that sum. For most advisers, the process will 
start with a set of sub-portfolio modules (such as those we briefly discussed in Section 
15 and will study in more depth in Section 17). When using a set of pre-optimized modules, the adviser will then need to identify the module best suited to each of the specific goals of the client. That process is always driven by the client’s time horizon and required probability of success, and it involves identifying the module that offers the highest possible return given the investor’s risk tolerance as characterized by a given required probability of success over a given time horizon.16

ules result from an optimization process that will be explained later.33 In the exhibit,

Learning Module 4  Principles of A sset Allocation 262
In Exhibit 36, the top section, on portfolio characteristics, presents the expected 
return and expected volatility of each module. Below that are four sections, one for 
each of four time horizons: 5, 10, 20, and 25 years. In a given section, the entries are 
the returns that are expected for a given required probability of achieving success. For 
example, at a 10-year horizon and a 90% required probability of success, Modules A, 
B, C, D, E, and F are expected to return, respectively, 3.2%, 3.7%, 4.0%, 4.1%, 4.0%, and 
3.6%. In this case, Module D would be selected to address a goal with this time horizon 
and required probability of success because its 4.1% expected return is higher than those of all the other modules. Thus, Module D offers the lowest “funding cost” for the given goal. The highest expected return translates to the lowest initially required capital when the expected cash flows associated with the goal are discounted using that expected return.
EXAMPLE 11
Selecting a Module
Address the following module selection problems using Exhibit 36:
1.
 A c
lient describes a desire to have a reserve of €2 million for business op-
portunities that may develop when he retires in five years. Assume that the 
word “desire” points to a wish to which the adviser will ascribe a probability of 75%.
Solution:
The time horizon is five years. Exhibit 36 shows that Module E has the high-est expected return (5.0%) over the five-year period and with the assumed 75% required probability of success.
2.
 A 70-
year-old client with a 20-year life expectancy discusses the need to be 
able to maintain her lifestyle for the balance of her life and wishes to leave US$3 million to be split among her three grandchildren at her death.
Solution:
The time horizon is 20 years. The first goal is a need, while the second is a wish. We assume a required probability of success of 95% for a need and 75% for a wish. Exhibit 36 shows that Module D provides the highest hori-zon- and required-probability-adjusted return (4.4%) for the first goal. Mod-ule F is better suited to the second goal because, even though the second goal has the same time horizon, it involves only a 75% required probability of success; the appropriately adjusted return is 6.8%, markedly the highest, which means the initially required capital is lower.
Returning to the Smiths, let us use that same set of modules to look at their four 
specific goals. The results of our analysis are presented in Exhibit 37.
1.
 The first go
al is a need, with a five-year time horizon and a 95% required 
probability of success. Looking at the 95% required probability line in the five-year time horizon section of Exhibit 36, we can see that the module with the highest expected return on a time horizon- and required probabil-ity-adjusted basis is Module A and that the appropriately adjusted expected return for that module is 2.3%. Discounting a US$500,000 annual cash flow, inflated by 2% a year from Year 2 onwards, required a US$2,430,000 initial investment. This amount represents 9.7% of the total financial wealth of the Smiths.

Constructing Sub-Portfolios and the Overall Portfolio 263
2. The s econd goal is a want, with a 25-year time horizon and an 85% required 
probability of success. The corresponding line of the table in Exhibit 36 
points to Module F and a discount rate of 6.1%. Discounting their current expenses with the same assumption over the 25 years starting in Year 6 with a 6.1% rate points to an initially required capital of US$6,275,000, represent -
ing 25.1% of the Smiths’ wealth.
3.
 The t
hird goal is another need, with a 10-year time horizon and a 90% 
required probability of success. Module D is the best module, and the US$6,691,000 required capital reflects the discounting of a US$10 million payment in 10 years at the 4.1% indicated in Exhibit 36.
4.
 F
inally, the fourth goal is a wish with a 20-year time horizon and a 75% 
required probability of success. Module F is again the best module, and the discounting of a US$10 million payment 20 years from now at the 6.8% expected return from Exhibit 36 points to a required capital of US$2,683,000 today.
Note that different goals may, in fact, be optimally addressed using the same 
module; thus, an individual module may be used more than once in the allocation of the individual’s overall financial assets. Here, Goals 2 and 4 can both be met with the riskiest of the six modules, although their time horizons differ, as do the required 
probabilities of success, with Goal 2 being characterized as a want and Goal 4 as a wish.

Note also that the Smiths’ earlier worry, that they might not be able to meet all their 
goals, can be addressed easily. Our assumptions suggest that, in fact, they have excess 
capital representing 27.7% of their total financial wealth. They can either revisit their 
current goals and bring the timing of payments forward or raise their probability of success. The case suggests that they would rather think of additional goals but will want to give themselves some time to refine their intentions. Their adviser then sug-gests that a “middle of the road” module be used as a “labeled goal” for that interim period, and they call this module (Module C) “capital preservation. ”

The Overall Portfolio
Assuming the same six modules, with their detailed composition shown in Exhibit 38, 
one can then derive the overall asset allocation by aggregating the individual expo-
sures to the various modules. In short, the overall allocation is simply the weighted average exposure to each of the asset classes or strategies within each module, with the weight being the percentage of financial assets allocated to each module. Exhibit 
39 presents these computations and the overall asset allocation, which is given in bold 
in the right-most column. The overall portfolio’s expected return and volatility are also 
shown. In Exhibit 38, liquidity34 is measured as one minus the ratio of the average 
number of days that might be needed to liquidate a position to the number of trading days in a year. (Note that the column B values add up to 101 because of rounding.)

Ostensibly, in the real world, the process ought to be associated with a set of 
after-tax expectations, which usually cannot be limited to broad asset classes or sub–
asset classes. Indeed, the tax impact of management processes within individual asset 
classes or strategies (for instance, index replication, index replication with systematic 
tax-loss harvesting, broadly diversified portfolios, or concentrated portfolios) requires 
that each management process within each asset class or strategy be given its own 
expected return and volatility. We will dispense with that step here for the sake of simplicity, both in absolute terms and with respect to jurisdictional differences.
Exhibit 41 presents a possible set of such modules based on the capital market 
expectations from Exhibit 40. The optimization uses a mean–variance process and is subject to a variety of constraints that are meant to reflect both market portfolio considerations and reasonable asset class or strategy suitability given the goals that we expect to correspond to various points on the frontier. Note that the frontier is not “efficient” in the traditional sense of the term because the constraints applied to 
the portfolios differ from one to the next. Three elements within the set of constraints 
deserve special mention. The first is the need to be concerned with the liquidity of the various strategies: It would make little sense, even if it were appropriate based on other considerations, to include any material exposure to illiquid equities in a declining-balance portfolio expected to “mature” within 10 years, for instance. Any exposure thus selected would be bound to increase through time because portfolio 
liquidation focuses on more-liquid assets. The second relates to strategies whose return 
distributions are known not to be “normal. ” This point applies particularly to a number 
of alternative strategies that suffer from skew and kurtosis,37 which a mean–variance 
optimization process does not take into account (see Section 6). Finally, the constraints 
contain a measure of drawdown control to alleviate the problems potentially asso-ciated with portfolios that, although apparently optimal, appear too risky in overly challenging market circumstances. Drawdown controls are an important element in that they help deal with the often-observed asymmetric tolerance of investors for volatility: upward volatility is much preferred to downward volatility.
37 Ka t (2003) described the challenge, and Davies, Kat, and Lu (2009) presented a solution that involves the use of mean–variance-skew-kurtosis optimization, which is typically too complex for most real-life circumstances.

cover a wide spectrum of the investment universe, ranging from a nearly all-cash portfolio (Portfolio A) to an all-equity alternative (Portfolio F). Second, they are suf -
ficiently differentiated to avoid creating distinctions without real differences. These portfolios are graphed in Exhibit 42.

Returning to an earlier point about “labeled goals, ” one can easily imagine “aspira-
tions” to describe each of these modules, ranging from “immediate- to short-term 
lifestyle” for Module A to “aggressive growth” for Module F. Module B might be labeled 
“long-term lifestyle, ” while C and D might represent forms of capital preservation and 
E a form of “balanced growth. ”
A final point deserves special emphasis: Modules need to be revisited on a periodic 
basis. While equilibrium assumptions will likely not change much from one year to the 
next, the need to identify one’s position with respect to a “normal” market cycle can 
lead to modest changes in forward-looking assumptions. It would indeed be foolish to 
keep using long-term equilibrium assumptions when it becomes clear that one is closer 
to a market top than to a market bottom. The question of the suitability of revisions 
becomes moot when using a systematic approach such as the Black–Litterman model. 
One may also need to review the continued suitability of constraints, not to mention (when applicable) the fact that the make-up of the market portfolio may change in terms of geography or credit distribution.
ISSUES RELATED TO GOALS-BASED ASSET 
ALLOCATION
recommend and justify an asset allocation using a goals-based 
approach
Once set, the goals-based allocation must be regularly reviewed. Two considerations dominate:

 G
oals with an initially fixed time horizon are not necessarily one year closer 
to maturity after a year. Superficially, one would expect that someone who says that his or her need is to meet lifestyle expenditures over the next five years, for instance, means exactly this. Accordingly, next year, the time horizon should shift down to four years. Yet experience suggests that certain 18

horizons are “placeholders”: One year on, the time horizon remains five 
years. This is particularly—and understandably—relevant when the horizon reflects the anticipated death of an individual.
2.
 The pr
eference for upward rather than downward volatility, combined with 
perceptions that goals may have higher required probabilities of success than is truly the case, leads to portfolios that typically outperform the discount rate used to compute the required initial capital. Thus, one would expect there to be some need for portfolio rebalancing when the assets allocated to certain goals appear excessive, at least in probability- and hori-zon-adjusted terms. This situation gives rise to important discussions with taxable clients because any form of portfolio rebalancing is inherently more complex and costly in a taxable environment than when taxes do not come into consideration.
Issues Related to Goals-Based Asset Allocation
Although goals-based asset allocation offers an elegant and mathematically sound way to deal with the circumstances of individuals, it is not a panacea. By definition, goals-based asset allocation applies best to individuals who have multiple goals, time 
horizons, and urgency levels. The classic example of the professional who is just 
starting to save for retirement and who has no other significant goal (as in the case of Aimée Goddard in Example 1) can be easily be handled with the traditional financial tools discussed in the earlier sections of this reading.
38 However, one should always 
be cautious to ensure that there is no “hidden” goal that should be brought out and that the apparently “single” retirement goal is not in fact an aggregation of several 
elements with different levels of urgency, if not also different time horizons. Single-goal 
circumstances may still be helped by the goals-based asset allocation process when 
there are sustainability or behavioral questions. In that case, one can look at the single 
goal as being made up of several similar goals over successive time periods with dif -
ferent required probabilities of success. For instance, one might apply a higher sense of urgency—and thus require a lower risk profile—to contributions made in the first few years, on the ground that adverse market circumstances might negatively affect 
the willingness of the client to stay with the program. In many ways, this approach can 
be seen as a conceptual analog to the dollar-cost-averaging investment framework.
Goals-based asset allocation is ideally suited to situations involving multiple goals, 
time horizons, and urgency levels, whether the assets are large or more modest. In fact, in cases where “human capital” is considered, a multi-goal approach can help 
investors understand the various trade-offs they face. Ostensibly, the larger the assets, 
the more complex the nature of the investment problem, the more diverse the list of investment structures, and the more one should expect a client-focused approach to 
offer useful benefits. However, the ratio of cash outflows to assets under consideration 
is a more germane issue than the overall size of the asset pool.
38 H owever, an adviser may find it appropriate to help the individual divide the funds he or she believes are needed for retirement into several categories. For instance, there may be some incompressible lifestyle expenditure that represents a minimum required spending level, but there may also be some luxury or at least compressible spending that does not have such a high level of urgency or that applies over a different time frame (say, the early or late years). Thus, one could still describe the problem as involving multiple goals, multiple time horizons, and multiple urgency levels. Then, one could compare the costs associated with the funding of these goals and have the individual weigh potential future satisfaction against the loss of current purchasing power.

Heuristics and Other Approaches to Asset Allocation 271
Advisers using goals-based wealth management must contend with a considerably 
higher level of business management complexity. They will naturally expect to have a 
different policy for each client and potentially more than one policy per client. Thus, managing these portfolios day to day and satisfying the usual regulatory requirement 
that all clients be treated in an equivalent manner can appear to be a major quandary.
Typically, the solution would involve developing a systematic approach to decision 
making such that it remains practical for advisers to formulate truly individual policies 
that reflect their investment insights. Exhibit 43 offers a graphical overview of advisers’ 
activities, divided into those that involve “firm-wide” processes, defined as areas where 
no real customization is warranted, and those that must remain “client focused. ” The result is analogous to a customized racing bicycle, whose parts are mass produced but then combined into a truly unique bike custom-designed for the individual racer.

HEURISTICS AND OTHER APPROACHES TO ASSET 
ALLOCATION
describe and evaluate heuristic and other approaches to asset 
allocation
In addition to the various asset allocation approaches already covered, a variety of heuristics (rules that provide a reasonable but not necessarily optimal solution) and other techniques deserve mention:19

Learning Module 4  Principles of A sset Allocation 272
The “120 Minus Your Age” Rule
The phrase “120 minus your age” is a heuristic for inferring a hidden, age-driven 
risk tolerance coefficient that then leads directly to an age-based stock versus fixed income split: 120 − Age = Percentage allocated to stocks. Thus, a 25-year-old man would allocate 95% of his investment portfolio to stocks. Although we are aware of no theoretic basis for this heuristic—or its older and newer cousins, “100 minus your age” and “125 minus your age, ” respectively—it results in a linear decrease in equity exposure that seems to fit the general equity glide paths associated with target-date funds, including those that are based on a total balance sheet approach that includes 
human capital. A number of target-date funds (sometimes called life-cycle or age-based 
funds) and some target-date index providers report that their glide path (the age-based 
change in equity exposure) is based on the evolution of an individual’s human capital. 
For example, one set of indexes39 explicitly targets an investable proxy for the world 
market portfolio in which the glide path is the result of the evolving relationship of financial capital to human capital.
40
Exhibit 44 displays the glide paths of the 60 largest target-date fund families in the 
United States. The retirement year (typically part of the fund’s name) on the x -axis 
denotes the year in which the investor is expected to retire, which is almost always assumed to be the year the investor turns 65. Thus, as of 2016, the 2060 allocations 
correspond to a 21-year-old investor (79% equity, using the heuristic), whereas the 2005 
allocation corresponds to a 76-year-old investor (24% equity, using the heuristic).41 
One dashed line represents the equity allocation based on the “100 minus your age” 
heuristic, while another dashed line represents the “120 minus your age” heuristic. The 
heuristic lines lack some of the nuances of the various glide path lines, but it would appear that an age-based heuristic leads to asset allocations that are broadly similar to those used by target-date funds.

Heuristics and Other Approaches to Asset Allocation 273
The 60/40 Stock/Bond Heuristic
Some investors choose to skip the various optimization techniques and simply adopt 
an asset allocation consisting of 60% equities and 40% fixed income.
The equity allocation is viewed as supplying a long-term growth foundation, and 
the fixed-income allocation as supplying risk reduction benefits. If the stock and bond 
allocations are themselves diversified, an overall diversified portfolio should result.
There is some evidence that the global financial asset market portfolio is close to 
this prototypical 60/40 split. Exhibit 45 displays the estimated market value of eight major components of the market portfolio from 1990 to 2012. In approximately 7 of the 23 years, equities, private equity, and real estate account for slightly more than 60%, while for the rest of the time, the combined percentage is slightly less.

The Endowment Model
An approach to asset allocation that emphasizes large allocations to non-traditional investments, including equity-oriented investments driven by investment manager skill (e.g., private equities), has come to be known as the endowment model or Yale model. The label “Yale model” reflects the fact that the Yale University Investments Office under David Swensen pioneered the approach in the 1990s; the label “endow -
ment model” reflects the influence of this approach among US university endowments. 
Swensen (2009) stated that most investors should not pursue the Yale model but should 
instead embrace a simpler asset allocation implemented with low-cost funds. Besides 
high allocations to non-traditional assets and a commitment to active management, 
the approach characteristically seeks to earn illiquidity premiums, which endowments 
with long time horizons are well positioned to capture. Exhibit 46, showing the Yale 
endowment asset allocation, makes these points. In the exhibit, “absolute return” 
indicates investment in event-driven and value-driven strategies.

In almost diametrical contrast to the endowment model is the asset allocation approach 
of Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global (Statens pensjonsfond Utland), often 
called the Norway model.42 This model’s asset allocation is highly committed to pas -
sive investment in publicly traded securities (subject to environmental, social, and 
governance [ESG] concerns), reflecting a belief in the market’s informational efficiency. 
Since 2009, the asset allocation has followed an approximate 60/40 stock/bond mix.
Risk Parity
A risk parity asset allocation is based on the notion that each asset (asset class or risk factor) should contribute equally to the total risk of the portfolio for a portfolio to be well diversified. Recall that in Sections 2–9, we identified various criticisms and potential shortcomings of mean–variance optimization, one of which was that, while the resulting asset allocations may appear diversified across assets, the sources of risk may not be diversified. In the section on risk budgeting, Exhibit 19 contained a risk decomposition of a reverse-optimization-based asset allocation from a United Kingdom–based investor. There, we noted that the overall equity/fixed income split was approximately 54% equities and 46% fixed income, yet of the 10% standard devi-ation, approximately 74% of the risk came from equities while only 26% came from fixed income.
Risk parity is a relatively controversial approach. Although there are several vari-
ants, the most common risk parity approach has the following mathematical form:
   w  i   × Cov    (   r  i  ,  r  P   )     =   1 _ n    σ  P  2    (3)
wher
e
 
wi = the weight of asset i
 
Cov(ri,rP) = the covariance of asset i  with the portfolio
 
n = the number of assets
   σ  P  2    = the variance of the portfolio
In general, there is not a closed-form solution to the problem, and it must be solved 
using some form of optimization (mathematical programming). Prior to Markowitz’s 
development of mean–variance optimization, which simultaneously considered 
both risk and return, most asset allocation approaches focused only on return and

Heuristics and Other Approaches to Asset Allocation 275
ignoredrisk (or accounted for it in an ad hoc manner). The primary criticism of risk 
parity is that it makes the opposite mistake: It ignoresexpected returns. In general, most of the rules-based risk approaches—such as other forms of volatility weighting, minimum volatility, and target volatility—suffer from this shortcoming.
With risk parity, the contribution to risk is highly dependent on the formation of 
the opportunity set. For example, if the opportunity set consists of seven equity asset classes and three fixed-income asset classes, intuitively, 70% of risk will come from the equities and 30% of risk will come from fixed income. Conversely, if the oppor -
tunity set consists of three equity asset classes and seven fixed-income asset classes, intuitively, 70% of risk will come from fixed income and 30% of risk will come from equities. The point is that practitioners of risk parity must be very cognizant of the formation of their opportunity set.
Exhibit 47 gives a US-centric example consisting of five equity asset classes and 
three fixed-income asset classes. A constrained optimization routine (weights must sum to 100%) was used to determine the weight to each asset class, such that all asset classes contributed the same amount to total risk. In this case, each asset class con-
tributed 0.8%, resulting in an asset allocation with a total standard deviation of 6.41%. 
In this example, 5/8 of total risk comes from equity asset classes and 3/8 comes from 
fixed-income asset classes. Earlier, we explained that reverse optimization can be used 
to infer the expected return of any set of presumed efficient weights. In Exhibit 47, based on a total market risk premium of 2.13% and a risk-free rate of 3%, we inferred 
the reverse-optimized total returns (final column). In this case, these seem to be 
relatively reasonable expected returns.

After deriving a risk parity–based asset allocation, the next step in the process is to 
borrow (use leverage) or to lend (save a portion of wealth, presumably in cash) so that the overall portfolio corresponds to the investor’s risk appetite. Continuing with our example, the market risk premium is 2.13% (above the assumed risk-free rate of 3%) and the market variance is 0.41% (i.e., 6.41% squared); thus, the implied market 
trade-off of expected return (in excess of the risk-free rate) for risk is 2.13% divided by 
0.41%, which equals approximately 5.2. Investors with a greater appetite for risk than 
the market as a whole would borrow money to lever up the risk parity portfolios, while 
investors with a lower appetite for risk would invest a portion of their wealth in cash.

Back tests of levered risk parity portfolios have produced promising results, 
although critics of these back tests argue that they suffer from look-back bias and are 
very dependent on the ability to use extremely large amounts of leverage at low borrow 
rates (which may not have been feasible); see, for example, Anderson, Bianchi, and 
Goldberg (2012). Proponents of risk parity have suggested that the idea of “leverage 
aversion” contributes to the success of the strategy. Black (1972) suggested that restric -
tions on leverage and a general aversion to leverage may cause return-seeking investors 
to pursue higher-returning assets, such as stocks. All else equal, this behavior would 
reduce the price of bonds, thus allowing the investor to buy bonds at a small discount, 
hold them to maturity, and realize the full value of the bond. Asness, Frazzini, and Pedersen (2012) have offered this idea as a potential explanation for why a levered (bond-centric) asset allocation might outperform an equity-centric asset allocation with equivalent or similar risk.
The 1/N Rule
One of the simplest asset allocation heuristics involves equally weighting allocations to assets. DeMiguel, Garlappi, and Uppal (2009) define an approach in which 1/N  of 
wealth is allocated to each of N assets available for investment at each rebalancing 
date. Calendar rebalancing to equal weighting at quarterly intervals is one common 
rebalancing discipline used. By treating all assets as indistinguishable in terms of mean 
returns, volatility, and correlations, in principle, 1/N  rule portfolios should be domi-
nated by methods that optimize asset class weights to exploit differences in investment 
characteristics. In empirical studies comparing approaches, however, the 1/N  rule 
has been found to perform considerably better, based on Sharpe ratios and certainty equivalents, than theory might suggest. One possible explanation is that the 1/N  rule 
sidesteps problems caused by optimizing when there is estimation error in inputs.
PORTFOLIO REBALANCING IN PRACTICE
discuss factors affecting rebalancing policy
The reading “Introduction to Asset Allocation” provided an introduction to rebalanc -
ing, including some detailed comments on strategic considerations. This section aims 
to present useful additional insight and information.
MEANINGS OF “REBALANCING”
Rebalancing has been defined as the discipline of adjusting portfolio weights to more closely align with the strategic asset allocation. In that sense, rebalancing includes policy regarding the correction of any drift away from strategic asset allocation weights resulting from market price movements and the passage of time for finite-lived assets, such as bonds. In liability-relative asset allocation, adjusting a liability-hedging portfolio to account for changes in net duration exposures from the passage of time, for example, would fall under the rubric of rebalancing.
Some use the term “rebalancing” more expansively, to include the combined 
effects on asset class weights not only of rebalancing in the above sense but also 
of active allocation activities. In that sense, rebalancing would include tactical 20

Portfolio Rebalancing in Practice 277
allocations. Although rebalancing policy can be established to accommodate 
tactical adjustments, tactical asset allocation per se is not covered under “rebal -
ancing” as the term is used here.
Changes in asset allocation weights in response to changes in client circum -
stances, goals, or other client factors are sometimes also referred to as “rebal-
ancing” (especially if the adjustments are minor). These activities fall under the scope of client monitoring and asset allocation review, as described elsewhere in the CFA curriculum.
An appropriate rebalancing policy involves a weighing of benefits and costs. 
Benefits depend on the idea that if an investor’s strategic asset allocation is optimal, 
then any divergence in the portfolio from that asset allocation represents an expected 
utility loss to the investor. Rebalancing benefits the investor by reducing the present value of expected losses from not tracking the optimum. In theory, the basic cost of not rebalancing is this present value of expected utility losses from straying from the optimum.
43
Apart from the above considerations of trade-offs, disciplined rebalancing has 
tended to reduce risk while incrementally adding to returns. Several interpretations of this empirical finding have been offered, including the following:
 ■Rebalancing earns a diversification return. The compound growth rate of a portfolio is greater than the weighted average compound growth rates of the component portfolio holdings (given positive expected returns and positive asset weights). Given sufficiently low transaction costs, this effect leads to what has been called a diversification return to frequent rebalancing to a well-diversified portfolio.
44
 ■Rebalancing earns a return from being short volatility. In the case of a port -
folio consisting of a risky asset and a risk-free asset, the return to a rebal-anced portfolio can be replicated by creating a buy-and-hold position in the portfolio, writing out-of-the-money puts and calls on the risky asset, and investing the premiums in risk-free bonds.
45 As the value of puts and calls is 
positively related to volatility, such a position is called being short volatility (or being short gamma, by reference to the option Greeks).
Practice appears not to have produced a consensus on the most appropriate rebal -
ancing discipline. Introduction to Asset Allocation defined and discussed calendar 
rebalancing46—sometimes mentioned as common in portfolios managed for individ -
ual investors—and percent-range rebalancing. Calendar rebalancing involves lower overhead because of lower monitoring costs. Percent-range rebalancing is a more disciplined risk control policy, however, because it makes rebalancing contingent on market movements. Without weighing costs and benefits in the abstract, Exhibit 48 assumes percent-range rebalancing and summarizes the effects of each of several key factors on the corridor width of an asset class, holding all else equal, except for the factor of the asset class’s own volatility.

capital gains in jurisdictions that tax them; therefore, for such investors, higher tax rates on capital gains should also be associated with wider corridors.

Exhibit 48: Factors Affecting the Optimal Corridor Width of an Asset Class
FactorEffect on Optimal Width of Corridor 
(All Else Equal) Intuition
Factors Positively Related to Optimal Corridor Width
Transaction costs The higher the transaction costs, the 
wider the optimal corridor.High transaction costs set a high hurdle for rebalancing benefits to overcome.
Risk tolerance The higher the risk tolerance, the wider the optimal corridor.Higher risk tolerance means less sensitivity to divergences from the target allocation.
Correlation with the rest of the portfolioThe higher the correlation, the wider the optimal corridor.When asset classes move in sync, further divergence from target weights is less likely.
Factors Inversely Related to Optimal Corridor Width
Volatility of the rest of the portfolio The higher the volatility, the narrower 
the optimal corridor.Higher volatility makes large divergences from 
the strategic asset allocation more likely.
Among positive factors, the cases of transaction costs and risk tolerance are obvious. 
Transaction costs can be reduced to the extent that portfolio cash flows can be used 
to rebalance. The case of correlation is less obvious. Because of correlations, the 
rebalancing triggers among different asset classes are linked.
Consider correlation in a two–asset class scenario. Suppose one asset class is above 
its target weight, so the other asset class is below its target weight. A further increase in the value of the overweight asset class implies, on average, a smaller divergence in 
the asset mix if the asset classes’ returns are more highly positively correlated (because 
the denominator in computing the overweight asset class’s weight is the sum of the 
values of the two asset classes). In a multi-asset-class scenario, all pair-wise asset class 
correlations would need to be considered, making the interpretation of correlations 
complex. To expand the application of the two-asset case’s intuition, one simplification 
involves considering the balance of a portfolio to be a single hypothetical asset and computing an asset class’s correlation with it.
As indicated in Exhibit 48, the higher the volatility of the rest of the portfolio, 
excluding the asset class being considered, the more likely a large divergence from 
the strategic asset allocation becomes. That consideration should point to a narrower 
optimal corridor, all else being equal.
In the case of an asset class’s own volatility, “holding all else equal” is not prac -
tically meaningful. If rebalancing did not involve transaction costs, then higher vol-atility would lead to a narrower corridor, all else equal, for a risk-averse investor.
48 
Higher volatility implies that if an asset class is not brought back into the optimal range after a given move away from it, the chance of an even further divergence from optimal is greater. In other words, higher volatility makes large divergence from the strategic asset allocation more likely. However, reducing a corridor’s width means more frequent rebalancing and higher transaction costs. Thus, the effect of volatility on optimal corridor width involves a trade-off between controlling transaction costs and controlling risk. Conclusions also depend on the assumptions made about asset price return dynamics.
In practice, corridor width is often specified to be proportionally greater, the higher 
an asset class’s volatility, with a focus on transaction cost control. In volatility-based 
rebalancing, corridor width is set proportionally to the asset class’s own volatility. In 
one variation of equal probability rebalancing (McCalla 1997), the manager specifies a 
corridor for each asset class in terms of a common multiple of the standard deviation of the asset class’s returns such that, under a normal probability assumption, each asset class is equally likely to trigger rebalancing.

Portfolio Rebalancing in Practice 279
EXAMPLE 12
Tolerance Bands for an Asset Allocation
An investment committee is reviewing the following strategic asset allocation:
Domestic equities 50% ± 5% (i.e., 45% to 55% of portfolio value)
International equities 15% ± 1.5%Domestic bonds 35% ± 3.5%
The market for the domestic bonds is relatively illiquid. The committee views 
the above corridors as appropriate if each asset class’s risk and transaction cost 
characteristics remain unchanged. The committee now wants to account for differences among the asset classes in setting the corridors.
Evaluate the implications of the following sets of facts for the stated tolerance 
bands, given an all-else-equal assumption in each case:
1.
 T
ax rates for international equities increase by 10 percentage points.
Solution:
The tolerance band for international equities should increase if the entity is 
a taxable investor.
2.
 T
ransaction costs in international equities increase by 20% relative to do-
mestic equities, but the correlation of international equities with domestic equities and bonds declines. What is the expected effect on the tolerance band for international equities?
Solution:
Increased transaction costs point to widening the tolerance band for in-ternational equities, but declining correlations point to narrowing it. The overall effect is indeterminate.
3.
 The vol
atility of domestic bonds increases. What is the expected effect on 
their tolerance band? Assume that domestic bonds are relatively illiquid.
Solution:
Given that the market for domestic bonds is relatively illiquid, the increase in volatility suggests widening the rebalancing band. Containing transaction costs is more important than the expected utility losses from allowing a larger divergence from the strategic asset allocation.
One decision involved in rebalancing policy is whether to adjust asset class holdings 
to their target proportions, to the limits of the corridors, or to within the corridors but not to target weights. Compared with rebalancing to target weights, rebalancing to the upper or lower limit of the allowed range results in less close alignment with 
target proportions but lower transaction costs—an especially important consideration 
in the case of relatively illiquid assets. The choice among alternatives may be influenced 
by judgmental tactical considerations.
Because one rebalancing decision affects later rebalancing decisions, the optimal 
rebalancing decisions at different points in time are linked. However, optimal rebal-ancing in a multi-period, multi-asset case is an unsolved problem.

Learning Module 4  Principles of A sset Allocation 280
The analysis of Dybvig (2005) suggests that fixed transaction costs favor rebalancing 
to the target weights and variable transaction costs favor rebalancing to the nearest 
corridor border (the interior of the corridor being therefore a “no trade zone”). A number of studies have contrasted rebalancing to target weights and rebalancing to 
the allowed range based on particular asset classes, time periods, and measures of the 
benefits of rebalancing. These studies have reached a variety of conclusions, suggesting 
that no simple, empirically based advice can be provided.
REBALANCING IN A GOALS-BASED APPROACH
The use of probability- and horizon-adjusted discount rates to size the various 
goal-defeasing sub-portfolios means that portfolios will usually produce returns 
that are higher than assumed. Thus, as time passes, the dollars allocated to the various sub-portfolios—other than labeled-goal portfolios—may be expected to exceed the actual requirements. For example, in average markets, returns should exceed the conservative requirements of a goal associated with a 90% required probability of success. Sub-portfolios with shorter time horizons for goals with high required probabilities of success will tend to contain relatively 
low-risk assets, whereas riskier assets may have high allocations in longer-horizon 
portfolios for goals with lower required probabilities of success. Thus, there is a greater chance that the exposure to lower-risk assets will creep up before one experiences the same for riskier assets. Thus, failing to rebalance the portfolio 
will gradually move it down the risk axis—and the defined efficient frontier—and 
thus lead the client to take less risk than he or she can bear.
SUMMARY
This reading has surveyed how appropriate asset allocations can be determined to meet the needs of a variety of investors. Among the major points made have been the following:
 ■The objective function of asset-only mean–variance optimization is to max -
imize the expected return of the asset mix minus a penalty that depends on risk aversion and the expected variance of the asset mix.
 ■Criticisms of MVO include the following:
 ●The outputs (asset allocations) are highly sensitive to small changes in the inputs.
 ●The asset allocations are highly concentrated in a subset of the available asset classes.
 ●Investors are often concerned with characteristics of asset class returns such as skewness and kurtosis that are not accounted for in MVO.
 ●While the asset allocations may appear diversified across assets, the sources of risk may not be diversified.
 ●MVO allocations may have no direct connection to the factors affecting any liability or consumption streams.
 ●MVO is a single-period framework that tends to ignore trading/rebal-ancing costs and taxes.

Portfolio Rebalancing in Practice 281
 ■Deriving expected returns by reverse optimization or by reverse optimiza-
tion tilted toward an investor’s views on asset returns (the Black–Litterman model) is one means of addressing the tendency of MVO to produce effi-cient portfolios that are not well diversified.
 ■Placing constraints on asset class weights to prevent extremely concentrated portfolios and resampling inputs are other ways of addressing the same concern.
 ■For some relatively illiquid asset classes, a satisfactory proxy may not be available; including such asset classes in the optimization may therefore be problematic.
 ■Risk budgeting is a means of making optimal use of risk in the pursuit of return. A risk budget is optimal when the ratio of excess return to marginal contribution to total risk is the same for all assets in the portfolio.
 ■Characteristics of liabilities that affect asset allocation in liability-relative asset allocation include the following:
 ●Fixed versus contingent cash flows
 ●Legal versus quasi-liabilities
 ●Duration and convexity of liability cash flows
 ●Value of liabilities as compared with the size of the sponsoring organization
 ●Factors driving future liability cash flows (inflation, economic conditions, interest rates, risk premium)
 ●Timing considerations, such longevity risk
 ●Regulations affecting liability cash flow calculations
 ■Approaches to liability-relative asset allocation include surplus optimization, a hedging/return-seeking portfolios approach, and an integrated asset–liability approach.
 ●Surplus optimization involves MVO applied to surplus returns.
 ●A hedging/return-seeking portfolios approach assigns assets to one of two portfolios. The objective of the hedging portfolio is to hedge the investor’s liability stream. Any remaining funds are invested in the return-seeking portfolio.
 ●An integrated asset–liability approach integrates and jointly optimizes asset and liability decisions.
 ■A goals-based asset allocation process combines into an overall portfolio a number of sub-portfolios, each of which is designed to fund an individual goal with its own time horizon and required probability of success.
 ■In the implementation, there are two fundamental parts to the asset alloca-tion process. The first centers on the creation of portfolio modules, while the second relates to the identification of client goals and the matching of these goals to the appropriate sub-portfolios to which suitable levels of capital are allocated.
 ■Other approaches to asset allocation include “120 minus your age, ” 60/40 stocks/bonds, the endowment model, risk parity, and the 1/N  rule.
 ■Disciplined rebalancing has tended to reduce risk while incrementally adding to returns. Interpretations of this empirical finding include that rebalancing earns a diversification return, that rebalancing earns a return from being short volatility, and that rebalancing earns a return to supplying liquidity to the market.

 ■Factors positively related to optimal corridor width include transaction 
costs, risk tolerance, and an asset class’s correlation with the rest of the portfolio. The higher the correlation, the wider the optimal corridor, because when asset classes move in sync, further divergence from target weights is less likely.
 ■The volatility of the rest of the portfolio (outside of the asset class under consideration) is inversely related to optimal corridor width.
 ■An asset class’s own volatility involves a trade-off between transaction costs and risk control. The width of the optimal tolerance band increases with transaction costs for volatility-based rebalancing.

Megan Beade and Hanna Müller are senior analysts for a large, multi-divisional money management firm. Beade supports the institutional portfolio managers, and Müller does the same for the private wealth portfolio managers.
Beade reviews the asset allocation in Exhibit 1, derived from a mean–variance 
optimization (MVO) model for an institutional client, noting that details of the MVO are lacking.
Exhibit 1: Asset Allocation and Market Weights (in percent)
Asset Classes Asset AllocationInvestable Global Mar-
ket Weights
Cash 0 —
US bonds 30 17
US TIPS 0 3
Non-US bonds 0 22
Emerging market equity 25 5
Non-US developed equity 20 29
US small- and mid-cap equity 25 4
US large-cap equity 0 20
The firm’s policy is to rebalance a portfolio when the asset class weight falls outside of a corridor around the target allocation. The width of each corridor is customized for each client and proportional to the target allocation. Beade recommends wider corridor widths for high-risk asset classes, narrower corri-dor widths for less liquid asset classes, and narrower corridor widths for taxable clients with high capital gains tax rates.
One client sponsors a defined benefit pension plan where the present value of 
the liabilities is $241 million and the market value of plan assets is $205 million. Beade expects interest rates to rise and both the present value of plan liabilities and the market value of plan assets to decrease by $25 million, changing the pen-sion plan’s funding ratio.
Beade uses a surplus optimization approach to liability-relative asset allocation 
based on the objective function
   U  m  LR  = E   (   R  s,m   )     − 0.005λ  σ   2    (   R  s,m   )     
wher
e E(Rs,m) is the expected surplus return for portfolio m, λ is the risk aversion 
coefficient, and σ2(Rs,m) is the variance of the surplus return. Beade establishes 
the expected surplus return and surplus variance for three different asset alloca-
tions, shown in Exhibit 2. Given λ = 1.50, she chooses the optimal asset mix.

Portfolios
  Return Standard Deviation
Portfolio 1 13.00% 24%
Portfolio 2 12.00% 18%
Portfolio 3 11.00% 19%
Client Haunani Kealoha has a large fixed obligation due in 10 years. Beade assess-
es that Kealoha has substantially more funds than are required to meet the fixed obligation. The client wants to earn a competitive risk-adjusted rate of return while maintaining a high level of certainty that there will be sufficient assets to meet the fixed obligation.
In the private wealth area, the firm has designed five subportfolios with differing 
asset allocations that are used to fund different client goals over a five-year hori-zon. Exhibit 3 shows the expected returns and volatilities of the subportfolios and the probabilities that the subportfolios will exceed an expected minimum return. Client Luis Rodríguez wants to satisfy two goals. Goal 1 requires a conservative portfolio providing the highest possible minimum return that will be met at least 95% of the time. Goal 2 requires a riskier portfolio that provides the highest mini-mum return that will be exceeded at least 85% of the time.

Müller uses a risk parity asset allocation approach with a client’s four–asset class portfolio. The expected return of the domestic bond asset class is the lowest of the asset classes, and the returns of the domestic bond asset class have the lowest covariance with other asset class returns. Müller estimates the weight that should be placed on domestic bonds.
Müller and a client discuss other approaches to asset allocation that are not based 
on optimization models or goals-based models. Müller makes the following com-ments to the client:
Comment 1
 An adv
antage of the “120 minus your age” heuristic over the 
60/40 stock/bond heuristic is that it incorporates an age-based 
stock/bond allocation.
Comment 2
 The Y
ale model emphasizes traditional investments and a com-
mitment to active management.

Investment adviser Carl Monteo determines client asset allocations using quanti-tative techniques such as mean–variance optimization (MVO) and risk budgets. Monteo is reviewing the allocations of three clients. Exhibit 1 shows the expected return and standard deviation of returns for three strategic asset allocations that apply to several of Monteo’s clients.
Exhibit 1: Strategic Asset Allocation Alternatives
  Adviser’s Forecasts
Asset Allocation Expected Return (%) Standard Deviation of Returns (%)
A 10 12.0
B 8 8.0
C 6 2.0
Monteo interviews client Mary Perkins and develops a detailed assessment of 
her risk preference and capacity for risk, which is needed to apply MVO to asset allocation. Monteo estimates the risk aversion coefficient (λ) for Perkins to be 8 and uses the following utility function to determine a preferred asset allocation for Perkins:
   U  m   = E   (   R  m   )     − 0.005λ  σ  m  2   
Anot
her client, Lars Velky, represents Velky Partners (VP), a large institutional 
investor with $500 million in investable assets. Velky is interested in adding less 
liquid asset classes, such as direct real estate, infrastructure, and private equity, to VP’s portfolio. Velky and Monteo discuss the considerations involved in applying many of the common asset allocation techniques, such as MVO, to these asset classes. Before making any changes to the portfolio, Monteo asks Velky about his knowledge of risk budgeting. Velky makes the following statements:
Statement 1
 An optim
um risk budget minimizes total risk.

Learning Module 4  Principles of A sset Allocation 290
Statement 2  R isk budgeting decomposes total portfolio risk into its constitu-
ent parts.
Statement 3
 An a
sset allocation is optimal from a risk-budgeting perspective 
when the ratio of excess return to marginal contribution to risk 
is different for all assets in the portfolio.
Monteo meets with a third client, Jayanta Chaterji, an individual investor. Mon-
teo and Chaterji discuss mean–variance optimization. Chaterji expresses concern about using the output of MVOs for two reasons:
Criticism 1: The asset allocations are highly sensitive to changes in the 
model inputs.
Criticism 2: The asset allocations tend to be highly dispersed across all avail-

ohn Tomb is an investment advisor at an asset management firm. He is develop-
ing an asset allocation for James Youngmall, a client of the firm. Tomb considers 
two possible allocations for Youngmall. Allocation A consists of four asset class-es: cash, US bonds, US equities, and global equities. Allocation B includes these same four asset classes, as well as global bonds. 
Youngmall has a relatively low risk tolerance with a risk aversion coefficient (λ) 
of 7. Tomb runs mean–variance optimization (MVO) to maximize the following utility function to determine the preferred allocation for Youngmall:

iktoria Johansson is newly appointed as manager of ABC Corporation’s pension 
fund. The current market value of the fund’s assets is $10 billion, and the present 
value of the fund’s liabilities is $8.5 billion. The fund has historically been man-aged using an asset-only approach, but Johansson recommends to ABC’s board of directors that they adopt a liability-relative approach, specifically the hedging/return-seeking portfolios approach. Johansson assumes that the returns of the fund’s liabilities are driven by changes in the returns of index-linked government bonds. Exhibit 1 presents three potential asset allocation choices for the fund.

The following information relates to questions 
17-18
Mike and Kerry Armstrong are a married couple who recently retired with total assets of $8 million. The Armstrongs meet with their financial advisor, Brent Abbott, to discuss three of their financial goals during their retirement. 
Goal 1:  An 85% chance of purchasing a vacation home for $5 million in five 
years.
Goal 2:  A 99% chance of being able to maintain their current annual expen-
ditures of $100,000 for the next 10 years, assuming annual inflation of 3% 
from Year 2 onward.
Goal 3:  A 75% chance of being able to donate $10 million to charitable 
foundations in 25 years.
Abbott suggests using a goals-based approach to construct a portfolio. He 
develops a set of sub-portfolio modules, presented in Exhibit 1. Abbott suggests investing any excess capital in Module A.

Learning Module 4  Principles of A sset Allocation 296
SOLUTIONS
1. A i s correct. The allocations in Exhibit 1 are most likely from an MVO model 
using historical data inputs. MVO tends to result in asset allocations that are 
concentrated in a subset of the available asset classes. The allocations in Exhibit 1 have heavy concentrations in four of the asset classes and no investment in the other four asset classes, and the weights differ greatly from global market weights. Compared to the use of historical inputs, the Black–Litterman and reverse-optimization models most likely would be less concentrated in a few asset classes and less distant from the global weights.
2.
 A i
s correct. Theoretically, higher-risk assets would warrant a narrow corridor 
because high-risk assets are more likely to stray from the desired strategic asset allocation. However, narrow corridors will likely result in more frequent rebal-ancing and increased transaction costs, so in practice corridor width is often specified to be proportionally greater the higher the asset class’s volatility. Thus, higher-risk assets should have a wider corridor to avoid frequent, costly rebalanc-ing costs. Her other suggestions are not correct. Less-liquid asset classes should have a wider, not narrower, corridor width. Less-liquid assets should have a wider corridor to avoid frequent rebalancing costs. For taxable investors, transactions trigger capital gains in jurisdictions that tax them. For such investors, higher tax rates on capital gains should be associated with wider (not narrower) corridor widths.
3.
 A i
s correct. The original funding ratio is the market value of assets divided by 
the present value of liabilities. This plan’s ratio is $205 million/$241 million = 0.8506. When the assets and liabilities both decrease by $25 million, the funding ratio will decrease to $180 million/$216 million = 0.8333.
4.
 B i
s correct. The objective function expected value is 
  U
  m  LR  = E    (   R  s,m   )     − 0.005 λ   σ    2    (   R  s,m   )     . λ i s equal to 1.5, and the expected value of 
the objective function is shown in the rightmost column below.
Portfolio E(Rs,m) σ2(Rs,m)   U  m  LR   =E(Rs,m) – 0.005(1.5)σ2(Rs,m)
1 13.00 576 8.68
2 12.00 324 9.57
3 11.00 361 8.29
Portfolio 2 generates the highest value, or utility, in the objective function.
5.
 C i
s correct. The hedging/return-seeking portfolios approach is best for this cli-
ent. Beade should construct two portfolios, one that includes riskless bonds that 
will pay off the fixed obligation in 10 years and the other a risky portfolio that earns a competitive risk-adjusted return. This approach is a simple two-step pro-cess of hedging the fixed obligation and then investing the balance of the assets in a return-seeking portfolio.
6.
 A i
s correct. Goal 1 requires a success rate of at least 95%, and Subportfolio A has 
the highest minimum expected return (2.05%) meeting this requirement. Goal 2 requires the highest minimum expected return that will be achieved 85% of the time. Subportfolio C meets this requirement (and has a minimum expected return of 3.26%).

Solutions 297
7. C i s correct. A risk parity asset allocation is based on the notion that each asset 
class should contribute equally to the total risk of the portfolio. Bonds have the 
lowest risk level and must contribute 25% of the portfolio’s total risk, so bonds must be overweighted (greater than 25%). The equal contribution of each asset class is calculated as:
   w  i   × Cov    (   r  i  ,  r  p   )     =   1 _ n    σ  p  2  
wher
e
 
wi = weight of asset i
 
Cov(ri,rp) = covariance of asset i  with the portfolio
 
n = number of assets
   σ  p  2   = variance of the portfolio
In this example, there are four asset classes, and the variance of the total portfolio 
is assumed to be 25%; therefore, using a risk parity approach, the allocation to each asset class is expected to contribute (1/4 × 25%) = 6.25% of the total vari-ance. Because bonds have the lowest covariance, they must have a higher relative weight to achieve the same contribution to risk as the other asset classes.
8.
 A i
s correct. Comment 1 is correct because the “120 minus your age” rule reduc-
es the equity allocation as the client ages, while the 60/40 rule makes no such adjustment. Comments 2 and 3 are not correct. The Yale model emphasizes in-vesting in alternative assets (such as hedge funds, private equity, and real estate) as opposed to investing in traditional asset classes (such as stock and bonds). The 1/N rule allocates an equal weight to each asset without regard to its investment characteristics, treating all assets as indistinguishable in terms of mean returns, volatility, and correlations.
9.
 C i
s correct. The risk aversion coefficient (λ) for Mary Perkins is 8. The utility of 
each asset allocation is calculated as follows:
Asset Allocation A:
 
UA = 10.0% – 0.005(8)(12%)2
  = 4.24%
A
sset Allocation B:
 
UB = 8.0% – 0.005(8)(8%)2
  = 5.44%
A
sset Allocation C:
 
UC = 6.0% – 0.005(8)(2%)2
  = 5.84%
Ther
efore, the preferred strategic allocation is Asset Allocation C, which gener-
ates the highest utility given Perkins’s level of risk aversion.
10.
 C i
s correct. Less liquid asset classes—such as direct real estate, infrastructure, 
and private equity—represent unique challenges when applying many of the 
common asset allocation techniques. Common illiquid asset classes cannot be readily diversified to eliminate idiosyncratic risk, so representing overall asset class performance is problematic. Furthermore, there are far fewer indexes that

attempt to represent aggregate performance for these less liquid asset classes 
than indexes of traditional highly liquid asset classes. Finally, the risk and return characteristics associated with actual investment vehicles—such as direct real estate funds, infrastructure funds, and private equity funds—are typically signifi-cantly different from the characteristics of the asset classes themselves.
11.
 B i
s correct. The goal of risk budgeting is to maximize return per unit of risk. A 
risk budget identifies the total amount of risk and attributes risk to its constituent parts. An optimum risk budget allocates risk efficiently.
12.
 A i
s correct. One common criticism of MVO is that the model outputs, the asset 
allocations, tend to be highly sensitive to changes in the model. Another common criticism of MVO is that the resulting asset allocations tend to be highly concen-trated in a subset of the available asset classes.
13.
 A i
s correct. The factors commonly used in the factor-based approach generally 
have low correlations with the market and with each other. This results from the fact that the factors typically represent what is referred to as a zero (dollar) investment or self-financing investment, in which the underperforming attri-bute is sold short to finance an offsetting long position in the better-performing attribute. Constructing factors in this manner removes most market exposure from the factors (because of the offsetting short and long positions); as a result, the factors generally have low correlations with the market and with one another. Also, the factors commonly used in the factor-based approach are typically simi-lar to the fundamental or structural factors used in multifactor models.

MVO provides a framework to determine how much to allocate to each asset 
class or to create the optimal asset mix. The given objective function is:
   U  m   = E   (   R  m   )     − 0.005λ  σ  m  2   
U
sing the given objective function and the expected returns and expect-
ed standard deviations for Allocations A and B, the expected utilities 
(certainty-equivalent returns) for the two allocations are calculated as:
 Allocation 
A: 6.7% – 0.005 (7) (11.9%)2 = 1.74%
 Allocation 
B: 5.9% – 0.005 (7) (10.7%)2 = 1.89%
Therefore, Tomb should recommend Allocation B because it results in higher expected utility than Allocation A.

 ●The asset allocation weights for the reverse optimization method are 
inputs into the optimization and are determined by the market capital-ization weights of the global market portfolio.
 ●The asset allocation weights for the MVO method are outputs of the optimization with the expected returns, covariances, and a risk aversion coefficient used as inputs.
 ●The two methods result in significantly different asset allocation mixes.
 ●In contrast to MVO, the reverse optimization method results in a higher percentage point allocation to global bonds, US bonds, and global equities as well as a lower percentage point allocation to cash and US equities. 
The reverse optimization method takes the asset allocation weights as its inputs that are assumed to be optimal. These weights are calculated as the market capitalization weights of a global market portfolio. In contrast, the outputs of an MVO are the asset allocation weights, which are based on (1) expected returns and covariances that are forecasted using historical data and (2) a risk aversion coefficient. The two methods result in signifi-cantly different asset allocation mixes. In contrast to MVO, the reverse optimization method results in a 4.9, 5.5, and 10.1 higher percentage point allocation to US bonds, global equities, and global bonds, respectively, and a 6.1 and 14.4 lower percentage point allocation to cash and US equities, respectively.

 ●For the reverse optimization approach, the expected returns of asset 
classes are the outputs of optimization with the market capitalization weights, covariances, and the risk aversion coefficient used as inputs.
 ●In contrast, for the MVO approach, the expected returns of asset classes are inputs to the optimization, with the expected returns generally esti-mated using historical data.
 ●The computed values for the expected returns for global bonds and US equities using the reverse optimization method are 5.3% and 9.7%, respectively.
 ●In contrast, the expected return estimates used in the MVO approach from Exhibit 1 for global bonds and US equities are 4.7% and 8.6%, respectively.

The output of the reverse optimization method are optimized returns 
which are viewed as unobserved equilibrium or imputed returns. The equilibrium returns are essentially long-run capital market returns pro-vided by each asset class and are strongly linked to CAPM. In contrast, the expected returns in the MVO approach are generally forecasted based on historical data and are used as inputs along with covariances and the risk aversion coefficient in the optimization. The reverse-optimized returns are calculated using a CAPM approach. The return on an asset class using the CAPM approach is calculated as follows:
 Return 
on Asset Class = Risk-Free Rate + (Beta) (Market Risk Premium)
Therefore, the implied returns for global bonds and US equities are calcu-lated as follows:
 Return 
on Global Bonds = 2.0% + (0.6) (5.5%) = 5.3%
 Return 
on US Equities = 2.0% + (1.4) (5.5%) = 9.7%
The implied equilibrium returns for global bonds and US equities are 5.3% and 9.7%, respectively. These implied returns are above the fore-casted returns based on historical data (from Exhibit 1) used as inputs in the MVO approach for global bonds and US equities of 4.7% and 8.6%, respectively.

Justify your response.
 ■Allocation 3 is most appropriate.
 ■To fully hedge the fund’s liabilities, 85% ($8.5 billion/$10.0 billion) of the 
fund’s assets would be linked to index-linked government bonds.
 ■Residual $1.5 billion surplus would be invested into a return-seeking portfolio.
The pension fund currently has a surplus of $1.5 billion ($10.0 billion – $8.5 bil-
lion). To adopt a hedging/return-seeking portfolios approach, Johansson would first hedge the liabilities by allocating an amount equal to the present value of the fund’s liabilities, $8.5 billion, to a hedging portfolio. The hedging portfolio must include assets whose returns are driven by the same factors that drive the returns of the liabilities, which in this case are the index-linked government bonds. 
So, Johansson should allocate 85% ($8.5 billion/$10.0 billion) of the fund’s assets 
to index-linked government bonds. The residual $1.5 billion surplus would then be invested into a return-seeking portfolio. Therefore, Allocation 3 would be the most appropriate asset allocation for the fund because it allocates 85% of the fund’s assets to index-linked government bonds and the remainder to a return-seeking portfolio consisting of corporate bonds and equities.

 ■The module that should be selected for each goal is the one that offers the 
highest return given the time horizon and required probability of success.
 ■Approximately 16.4%, 12.7%, 50.4%, and 20.5% should be invested in Modules A, B, C, and D, respectively.
The appropriate goals-based allocation for the Armstrongs is as follows:

For Goal 1, which has a time horizon of five years and a required probability of 
success of 85%, Module C should be chosen because its 4.4% expected return is higher than the expected returns of all the other modules. The present value of Goal 1 is calculated as follows:

Learning Module 4  Principles of A sset Allocation 302
 N = 5, FV = –5,000,000, I/Y = 4.4%; CPT PV = $4,031,508 (or $4.03 million)
So, approximately 50.4% of the total assets of $8 million (= $4.03 million/$8.00 
million) should be allocated to Module C.
For Goal 2, which has a time horizon of 10 years and a required probability of 
success of 99%, Module B should be chosen because its 2.2% expected return is higher than the expected returns of all the other modules. The present value of Goal 2 is calculated as follows:
  PV =   $100, 000 _   (  1.022  )     1    +   $100, 000    (  1.03 )     1   ____________    (  1.022  )     2    +   $100, 000    (  1.03 )     2   ____________    (  1.022  )     3    + ⋯ +   $100, 000    (  1.03 )     9   ____________    (  1.022  )     10    
 PV
 = $1,013,670 (or $1.01 million)
So, approximately 12.7% of the total assets of $8 million (= $1.01 million/$8.00 
million) should be allocated to Module B.
For Goal 3, which has a time horizon of 25 years and a required probability of 
success of 75%, Module D should be chosen because its 7.5% expected return is higher than the expected returns of all the other modules. The present value of Goal 3 is calculated as follows:
 N 
= 25, FV = –10,000,000, I/Y = 7.5%; CPT PV = $1,639,791 (or $1.64 million)
So, approximately 20.5% of the total assets of $8 million (= $1.64 million/$8.00 million) should be allocated to Module D.
Finally, the surplus of $1,315,032 (= $8,000,000 – $4,031,508 – $1,013,670 – 
$1,639,791), representing 16.4% (= $1.32 million/$8.00 million), should be invest-ed in Module A following Abbott’s suggestion.

adaptations to the asset allocation inputs given an asset owner’s asset size, liquidity, and time horizon as well as external constraints that may affect the asset allocation choice (Sections 2–5). We also discuss the ways in which taxes influence the asset allocation process for the taxable investor (Sections 6–7). In addition, we discuss the 
circumstances that should trigger a re-evaluation of the long-term strategic asset 
allocation (Section 8), when and how an asset owner might want to make short-term shifts in asset allocation (Section 9), and how innate investor behaviors can inter -
fere with successful long-term planning for the investment portfolio (Section 10). Throughout the reading, we illustrate the application of these concepts using a series of hypothetical investors.1LEARNING MODULE

CONSTRAINTS IN ASSET ALLOCATION AND ASSET 
SIZE
discuss asset size, liquidity needs, time horizon, and regulatory or 
other considerations as constraints on asset allocation
General asset allocation principles assume that all asset owners have equal ability to access the entirety of the investment opportunity set, and that it is merely a matter of 
finding that combination of asset classes that best meets the wants, needs, and obliga -
tions of the asset owner. In practice, however, it is not so simple. An asset owner must 
consider a number of constraints when modeling and choosing among asset allocation 
alternatives. Some of the most important are asset size, liquidity needs, taxes, and time horizon. Moreover, regulatory and other external considerations may influence the investment opportunity set or the optimal asset allocation decision.
Asset Size
The size of an asset owner’s portfolio has implications for asset allocation. It may limit the opportunity set—the asset classes accessible to the asset owner—by virtue of the scale needed to invest successfully in certain asset classes or by the availability of investment vehicles necessary to implement the asset allocation.
Economies and diseconomies of scale are perhaps the most important factors rele -
vant to understanding asset size as a constraint. The size of an asset owner’s investment 
pool may be too small—or too large—to capture the returns of certain asset classes or strategies efficiently. Asset owners with larger portfolios can generally consider a broader set of asset classes and strategies. On the one hand, they are more likely to have sufficient governance capacity—sophistication and staff resources—to develop 
the required knowledge base for the more complex asset classes and investment 
vehicles. They also have sufficient size to build a diversified portfolio of investment strategies, many of which have substantial minimum investment requirements. On 
the other hand, some asset owners may have portfolios that are too  large; their desired 
minimum investment may exhaust the capacity of active external investment managers 
in certain asset classes and strategies. Although “too large” and “too small” are not 
rigidly defined, the following example illustrates the difficulty of investing a very large 
portfolio. Consider an asset owner with an investment portfolio of US$25 billion who 
is seeking to make a 5% investment in global small-cap stocks:
 ■The median total market capitalization of the stocks in the S&P Global SmallCap is approximately US$860 million as of November 2021.
 ■Assume a small-cap manager operates a 50-stock portfolio and is willing to own 3% of the market cap of any one of its portfolio companies. Their average position size would be US$26 million, and an effective level of assets under management (AUM) would be on the order of US$1.3 billion. Beyond that level, the manager may be forced to expand the portfolio beyond 50 stocks or to hold position sizes greater than 3% of a company’s market cap, which could then create liquidity issues for the manager.
 ■Now, our US$25 billion fund is looking to allocate US$1.25 billion to small-cap stocks (US$25 billion × 5%). They want to diversify this allocation across three or four active managers—a reasonable allocation of gover -
nance resources in the context of all of the fund’s investment activities. The average allocation per manager is approximately US$300 to US$400 million, 2

Constraints in Asset Allocation and Asset Size 305
which would constitute between 23% and 31% of each manager’s AUM. This 
exposes both the asset owner and the investment manager to an undesirable level of operational risk.
Although many large asset owners have found effective ways to implement a 
small-cap allocation, this example illustrates some of the issues associated with man-
aging a large asset pool. These include such practical considerations as the number of 
investment managers that might need to be hired to fulfill an investment allocation and 
the ability of the asset owner to identify and monitor the required number of managers.
Research has shown that investment managers tend to incur certain disadvantages 
from increasing scale: Growth in AUM leads to larger trade sizes, incurring greater price impact; capital inflows may cause active investment managers to pursue ideas 
outside of their core investment theses; and organizational hierarchies may slow down 
decision making and reduce incentives.1 Asset owners, however, are found to have 
increasing returns to scale, as discussed below.
A study of pension plan size and performance (using data spanning 1990–2008) 
found that large defined benefit plans outperformed smaller ones by 45–50 basis 
points per year on a risk-adjusted basis.2 The gains are derived from a combination 
of cost savings related to internal management, a greater ability to negotiate fees with 
external managers, and the ability to support larger allocations to private equity and real estate investments. As fund size increases, the “per participant” costs of a larger governance infrastructure decline and the plan sponsor can allocate resources away from such asset classes as small-cap stocks, which are sensitive to diseconomies of scale, to such other areas as private equity funds or co-investments where they are more likely to realize scale-related benefits.
Whereas owners of large asset pools may achieve these operating efficiencies, 
scale may also impose obstacles related to the liquidity and trading costs of the 
underlying asset. Above some size, it becomes difficult to deploy capital effectively in certain active investment strategies. As illustrated in Exhibit 1, owners of very large portfolios may face size constraints in allocating to active equity strategies. The studies referenced earlier noted that these asset owners frequently choose to invest passively in developed equity markets where their size inhibits alpha potential. The asset owner’s finite resources can then be allocated instead toward such strategies as private equity, hedge funds, and infrastructure, where their scale and resources provide a competitive advantage.

Learning Module 5  A sset Allocation with Real-World Constraints 306
Asset Class Investor Constraints by Size
 ■Developed market sovereign bonds
 ■Investment-grade bonds
 ■Non-investment-grade bonds
 ■Private real estate equityGenerally accessible to large and small asset owners, although to 
achieve prudent diversification, smaller asset owners may need to implement via a commingled vehicle.
Alternative Investments 
 ■Hedge funds
 ■Private debt
 ■Private equity
 ■Infrastructure
 ■Timberland and farmlandMay be accessible to large and small asset owners, although if offered as private investment vehicles, there may be legal minimum qualifica-tions that exclude smaller asset owners. The ability to successfully invest in these asset classes may also be limited by the asset owner’s level of investment understanding/expertise. Prudent diversification may require that smaller asset owners implement via a commingled vehicle, such as a fund of funds, or an ancillary access channel, such as a liquid alternatives vehicle or an alternatives ETF. For very large funds, the allocation may be constrained by the number of funds available.
Even in these strategies, very large asset owners may be constrained by scale. In 
smaller or less liquid markets, can a large asset owner invest enough that the expo-
sure contributes a material benefit to the broader portfolio? For example, a sovereign wealth fund or large public pension plan may not find enough attractive hedge fund managers to fulfill their desired allocation to hedge funds. True alpha is rare, limiting the opportunity set. Asset owners who find that they have to split their mandate into many smaller pieces may end up with an index-like portfolio but with high active management fees; one manager’s active bets may cancel out those of another active manager. A manager mix with no true alpha becomes index-like because the uncom-
pensated, idiosyncratic return variation is diversified away. A much smaller allocation 
may be achievable, but it may be too small to meaningfully affect the risk and return characteristics of the overall portfolio. More broadly, a very large size makes it more difficult to benefit from opportunistic investments in smaller niche markets or from 
skilled investment managers who have a small set of unique ideas or concentrated bets. 
No hard and fast rules exist to determine whether a particular asset owner is too small 
or too large to effectively access an asset class. Greater governance resources more 
commonly found among owners of larger asset pools create the capacity to pursue the 
more complex investment opportunities, but the asset owner may still need to find creative ways to implement the desired allocation. Each asset owner has a unique set of knowledge and constraints that will influence the opportunity set.
Smaller asset owners (typically institutions with less than US$500 million in assets 
and private wealth investors with less than US$25 million in assets) also find that their 
opportunity set may be constrained by the size of their investment portfolio. This is primarily a function of the more limited governance infrastructure typical of smaller asset owners: They may be too small to adequately diversify across the range of asset classes and investment managers or may have staffing constraints (insufficient asset 
size to justify a dedicated internal staff). Complex strategies may be beyond the reach 
of asset owners that have chosen not to develop investment expertise internally or where the oversight committee lacks individuals with sufficient investment under -
standing. In some asset classes and strategies, commingled investment vehicles can be used to achieve the needed diversification, provided the governing documents do not prohibit their use.
Access to other asset classes and strategies—private equity, private real estate, 
hedge funds, and infrastructure—may still be constrained for smaller asset owners. The commingled vehicles through which these strategies are offered typically require high minimum investments. For successful private equity and hedge fund managers, in particular, minimum investments can be in the tens of millions of (US) dollars, even for funds of funds.

Constraints in Asset Allocation and Asset Size 307
Regulatory restrictions can also impose a size constraint. In the United Kingdom, 
for example, an asset owner in a private investment vehicle must qualify as an elective 
professional client, meaning they must meet two of the following three conditions:
1.
 The c
lient has carried out transactions, in significant size, on the relevant 
market at an average frequency of 10 per quarter over the previous four 
quarters.
2.
 The si
ze of the client’s financial instrument portfolio exceeds €500,000.
3.
 The c
lient works or has worked in the financial sector for at least one year 
in a professional position, which requires knowledge of the transactions or services envisaged.
In the United States, investors must be either accredited or qualified purchasers to 
invest in many private equity and hedge fund vehicles. To be a qualified purchaser, a natural person must have at least US$5 million in investments, a company must have at least US$25 million in investable assets, and an investment manager must have at 
least US$25 million under management. In Hong Kong SAR, the Securities and Futures 
Commission requires that an investor must meet the qualifications of a “Professional Investor” to invest in certain categories of assets. A Professional Investor is generally 
defined as a trust with total assets of not less than HK$40 million, an individual with a 
portfolio not less than HK$8 million, or a corporation or partnership with a portfolio not less than HK$8 million or total assets of not less than HK$40 million. The size constraints related to these asset classes suggest that smaller asset owners have real challenges achieving an effective private equity or hedge fund allocation.
Asset size as a constraint is often a more acute issue for individual investors than 
institutional asset owners. Wealthy families may pool assets through such vehicles as family limited partnerships, investment companies, fund of funds, or other forms of commingled vehicles to hold their assets. These pooled vehicles can then access investment vehicles, asset classes, and strategies that individual family members may not have portfolios large enough to access on their own.
WHERE ASSET SIZE CONSTRAINS INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY
As of early 2021, the 10 largest sovereign wealth funds globally each exceed US$350 billion in assets. For a fund of this size, a 5% allocation to hedge funds (the average sovereign wealth fund allocation) would imply US$17.5 billion to be deployed. The global hedge fund industry manages approximately US$4.3 
trillion in total as of the second quarter of 2021. With about 10,000 hedge funds 
globally, the average asset size of a hedge fund thus would be US$430 million. At 
the same time, approximately 60% of the funds manage less than US$100 million, 
and the remaining 40% of the funds have an average size of near US$1 billion. If we assume that the asset owner would want to be no more than 20% of a firm’s AUM, we can infer that the average investment might be approximately US$86 million considering the full hedge fund universe or about US$200 million if we limit the choice to larger sized hedge funds. With US$17.5 billion to deploy, the fund would need to invest with nearly 90 (bigger size hedge funds universe) to 200 (total universe) funds to achieve a 5% allocation to hedge funds.

Asset Size Constraints in Asset Allocation
Describe asset size constraints that Aromdee might encounter in implementing 
this asset allocation. Discuss possible means to address them.
Given the asset size of the fund, formulate a set of questions regarding the 
feasibility of this recommendation that you would like staff to address at the 
next Investment Committee meeting.
The new president of the University has stated that he feels the current policy 
is overly restrictive, and he would like to see a more diversified program that takes advantage of the types of investment strategies used by large endowment programs. Choosing from among the following asset classes, propose a set of 
asset classes to be considered in the revised asset allocation. Justify your response.
 
 ■Cash equivalents and money market 
funds
 ■Large-cap developed market equity
 ■Small-cap developed market equity
 ■Emerging market equity
 ■Developed market sovereign bonds
 ■Investment-grade bonds ■Non-investment-grade bonds
 ■Private real estate equity

1. Ak karat Aromdee is the recently retired President of Alpha Beverage, a 
producer and distributor of energy drinks throughout Southeast Asia. 
Upon retiring, the company provided a lump sum retirement payment of THB880,000,000 (equivalent to €20 million), which was rolled over to a tax-deferred individual retirement savings plan. Aside from these assets, Aromdee owns company stock worth about THB70,000,000. The stock is infrequently traded. He has consulted with an investment adviser, and they are reviewing the following asset allocation proposal:
 
Global equities 40%
Global high-yield bonds 15%
Domestic intermediate bonds 30%
Hedge funds 10%
Private equity 5%
 
Solution:
With a THB88 million (€2 million) allocation to hedge funds and a THB44 million (€1 million) allocation to private equity funds, Aromdee may encounter restrictions on his eligibility to invest in the private investment vehicles typically used for hedge fund and private equity investment. To the extent he is eligible to invest in hedge funds and/or private equity funds, a fund-of-funds or similar commingled arrangement would be essential to achieving an appropriate level of diversification. Additionally, it is essential that he and his adviser develop the necessary level of expertise to invest in these alternative assets. To achieve a prudent level of diversification, the allocation to global high-yield bonds would most likely need to be accom-plished via a commingled investment vehicle.

2. The C AF$40 billion Government Petroleum Fund of Caflandia is overseen 
by a nine-member Investment Committee. The chief investment officer has 
a staff with sector heads in global equities, global bonds, real estate, hedge funds, and derivatives. The majority of assets are managed by outside invest-ment managers. The Investment Committee, of which you are a member, approves the asset allocation policy and makes manager selection decisions. Staff has recommended an increase in the private equity allocation from its current 0% to 15%, to be implemented over the next 12 to 36 months. The head of global equities will oversee the implementation of the private equity allocation.
Solution:
Questions regarding the feasibility of the recommendation include the following:
 ■How many private equity funds do you expect to invest in to achieve the 15% allocation to private equity?
 ■What is the anticipated average allocation to each fund?
 ■Are there a sufficient number of high-quality private equity funds will-ing to accept an allocation of that size?
 ■What expertise exists at the staff or board level to conduct due dili-gence on private equity investment funds?
 ■What resources does the staff have to oversee the increased allocation to private equity?
3.
 The Cour
neuve University Endowment has US$250 million in assets. 
The current allocation is 65% global large-capitalization stocks and 35% high-quality bonds, with a duration target of 5.0 years. The University has adopted a 5% spending policy. University enrollment is stable and expected to remain so. A capital spending initiative of US$100 million for new science buildings in the next three to seven years is being discussed, but it has not yet been approved. The University has no dedicated investment staff and makes limited use of external resources. Investment recommendations are formulated by the University’s treasurer and approved by the Investment Committee, composed entirely of external board members.
Solution:
Asset size and limited governance resources are significant constraints on the investment opportunity set available to the Endowment. The asset allocation should emphasize large and liquid investments, such as cash equivalents, developed and emerging market equity, and sovereign and investment-grade bonds. Some small portion of assets, however, could be allocated to commingled investments in real estate, private equity, or hedge funds. Given the University’s limited staff resources, it is necessary to ensure that the board members have the level of expertise necessary to select and monitor these more complex asset classes. The Endowment might also con-sider engaging an outside expert to advise on investment activities in these asset classes.

LIQUIDITY
discuss asset size, liquidity needs, time horizon, and regulatory or 
other considerations as constraints on asset allocation
Two dimensions of liquidity must be considered when developing an asset appropriate 
allocation solution: the liquidity needs of the asset owner and the liquidity character -
istics of the asset classes in the opportunity set. Integrating the two dimensions is an essential element of successful investment planning.
The need for liquidity in an investment portfolio will vary greatly by asset owner 
and by the goals the assets are set aside to achieve. For example, a bank will typically 
have a very large portfolio supporting its day-to-day operations. That portfolio is likely 
to experience very high turnover and a very high need for liquidity; therefore, the 
investment portfolio must hold high-quality, very short-term, and highly liquid assets.
The same bank may have another designated investment pool one level removed 
from operating assets. Although the liquidity requirements for this portfolio may be lower, the investments most likely feature a high degree of liquidity—a substantial 
allocation to investment-grade bonds, perhaps with a slight extension of maturity. For 
its longer-term investment portfolio, the bank may choose to allocate some portion of its portfolio to less liquid investments. The opportunity set for each portfolio will be constrained by applicable banking laws and regulations.
Long-term investors, such as sovereign wealth funds and endowment funds, can 
generally exploit illiquidity premiums available in such asset classes as private equity, real estate, and infrastructure investments. However, pension plans may be limited in the amount of illiquidity they can absorb. For example, a frozen pension plan may 
anticipate the possibility of eliminating its pension obligation completely by purchasing 
a group annuity and relinquishing the responsibility for making pension payments to an insurance company. If there is a significant probability that the company will take this step in the near term, liquidity of plan assets will become a primary concern; and if there is a substantial allocation to illiquid assets, the plan sponsor may be unable to execute the desired annuity purchase transaction.
Liquidity needs must also consider the particular circumstances and financial 
strength of the asset owner and what resources they may have beyond those held in the investment portfolio. The following examples illustrate this point:
 ■A university must consider its prospects for future enrollments and the extent to which it relies on tuition to meet operating needs. If the univer -
sity experiences a significant drop in enrollment, perhaps because of a poor economic environment, or takes on a new capital improvement project, the asset allocation policy for the endowment should reflect the increased prob-ability of higher outflows to support university operations.
 ■A foundation whose mission supports medical research in a field in which a breakthrough appears imminent may desire a higher level of liquidity to fund critical projects than would a foundation that supports ongoing com-munity efforts.
 ■An insurance company whose business is predominantly life or auto insur -
ance, where losses are actuarially predictable, can absorb more liquidity risk than a property/casualty reinsurer whose losses are subject to unpredictable events, such as natural disasters.
 ■A family with several children nearing college-age will have higher liquidity needs than a couple of the same age and circumstances with no children.3

Liquidity 311
When assessing the appropriateness of any given asset class for a given asset owner, 
it is wise to evaluate potential liquidity needs in the context of an extreme market 
stress event. The market losses of the 2008–2009 global financial crisis were extreme. Simultaneously, other forces exacerbated investors’ distress: Many university endow -
ments were called upon to provide an increased level of operating support; insurers dipped into reserves to offset operating losses; community foundations found their beneficiaries in even greater need of financial support; and some individual investors experienced setbacks that caused them to move, if only temporarily, from being net contributors to net spenders of financial wealth. A successful asset allocation effort 
will stress the proposed allocation; it will anticipate, where possible, the likely behavior 
of other facets of the saving/spending equation during times of stress.
It is also important to consider the intersection of asset class and investor liquidity 
in the context of the asset owner’s governance capacity. Although the mission of the organization or trust may allow for a certain level of illiquidity, if those responsible for the oversight of the investment program do not have the mental fortitude or dis -
cipline to maintain course through the crisis, illiquid and less liquid investments are 
unlikely to produce the rewards typically expected of these exposures. Although rates 
of return may be mean-reverting, wealth is not. Losses resulting from panic selling during times of stress become permanent losses; there are fewer assets left to earn returns in a post-crash recovery.
THE CASE OF VANISHING LIQUIDITY
In the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, many investors learned painful truths 
about liquidity. When most needed—whether to rebalance or to meet spending 
obligations—it can evaporate. As investors liquidated their most liquid assets to 
meet financial obligations (or to raise cash in fear of further market declines), the remaining less liquid assets in their portfolios became an ever-larger per -
centage of the portfolio. Many investors were forced to sell private partnership 
interests on the secondary market at steeply discounted prices. Others defaulted 
on outstanding private fund capital commitments by refusing to honor future obligations.
Similarly, illiquidity became a substantial problem during the Asian currency 
crisis of 1997–1998 and again with the Russian debt default and Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) crisis of 1998. In the following paragraphs, we 
describe several “liquidity crises” that are often used in stress testing asset 
allocation choices.
The Asian Currency Crisis of 1997
In the spring of 1997, Thailand spent billions to defend the Thai baht against 
speculative attacks, finally capitulating and devaluing the baht in July 1997. This 
triggered a series of moves throughout the region to defend currencies against 
speculators. Ultimately, these efforts were unsuccessful and many countries 
abandoned the effort and allowed their currencies to float freely. The Philippines, 
Indonesia, and South Korea abandoned their pegs against the US dollar. On 27 October 1997, rattled by the currency crisis, Asian and European markets declined sharply in advance of the opening of the US markets. The S&P 500 declined nearly 7%, and trading on US stock markets was suspended.
The Russian Debt Default/LTCM Crisis of August 1998
On 17 August 1998, the Russian government defaulted on its short-term debt. This 
unprecedented default of a sovereign debtor roiled the global bond markets. A 
global flight-to-quality ensued, which caused credit spreads to widen and liquidity 
to evaporate. Highly levered investors experienced significant losses. Long-Term

Learning Module 5  A sset Allocation with Real-World Constraints 312
Capital Management, with reported notional exposure of over US$125 billion 
(a 25-to-1 leverage ratio), exacerbated these price declines as they faced their own liquidity crisis and were forced to liquidate large relative value, distressed, convertible arbitrage, merger arbitrage, and equity positions. Ultimately, the 
magnitude of the liquidity squeeze for LTCM and the risk of potential disruption 
to global markets caused the New York branch of the Federal Reserve Bank to orchestrate a disciplined, structured bailout of the LTCM fund.
Financial markets are increasingly linked across borders and asset classes; as a 
result, changes in liquidity conditions in one country can directly affect liquidity 
conditions elsewhere. These linkages do improve access to financing and capital 
markets, but they also show that a liquidity problem in one part of the world 
can ripple across the globe—increasing volatility, creating higher execution 
costs for investors, and possibly leading to a reduction in credit availability and a decline in economic activity.
QUANTITATIVE EASING
While the lack of liquidity clearly hurts investors, can too much liquidity in the 
market place (overliquidity, excess liquidity) also cause problems? Overliquidity 
in the market, or too much cash, to put it simply, is certainly not an issue for 
frictionless trade executions. On the other hand, too much liquidity in the mar -
ket may lead to too high asset valuations as investors are trying to invest their excess liquidity, eroding the expected future returns of various asset classes. Following the Great Financial Crisis, as well as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks globally pumped extra cash into the economy through 
the asset purchase/quantitative easing (QE) programs to keep interest rates low 
and stimulate consumption. The impact of QE (measured by the size of the US Federal Reserve's balance sheet) on equity (S&P 500 Index) valuations and real interest rates (10-year Treasury real yield) are illustrated in Exhibit 2. With the increase of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in early 2020, the overliquidity fueled a strong rebound of the equity market.

Liquidity Constraints in Asset Allocation

benefit pension plan that is 85% funded. The plan has a provision that allows employees to elect a lump sum distribution of their pension benefit at retire-ment. The company is strong financially and is committed to fully funding the pension obligations over time. However, they also want to minimize cash contributions to the plan. Few governance resources are allocated to

the pension fund, and there is no dedicated staff for pension investment 
activities. The current asset allocation is as shown:
 
Global equities 20%
Private equity 10%
Real estate 10%
Infrastructure 5%
Hedge funds 15%
Bonds 40%
 
The company expects to reduce their employee headcount sometime in the next three to five years, and they are tentatively planning incentives to encourage employees to retire early.
Discuss the appropriateness of the current asset allocation strategy for the 
pension fund, including benefits and concerns.
Solution:
In addition to the size constraints a £200 million (≈ US$250 million) plan faces when attempting to invest in real estate, private equity, infrastructure, and hedge funds, the likelihood of early retirement incentives and lump-sum distribution requests in the next three to five years indicates a need for increased sensitivity to liquidity concerns. Investments in private equity, infrastructure, and real estate may be unsuitable for the plan given their less liquid nature. Although hedge fund investments would likely be accessible via a commingled vehicle, the liquidity of the commingled vehicle should be evaluated to determine if it is consistent with the liquidity needs of the plan.
TIME HORIZON
discuss asset size, liquidity needs, time horizon, and regulatory or other considerations as constraints on asset allocation
An asset owner’s time horizon is a critical constraint that must be considered in any asset allocation exercise. A liability to be paid at a given point in the future or a goal 
to be funded by a specified date each define the asset owner’s horizon, thus becoming 
a basic input to the asset allocation solution. The changing composition of the asset 
owner’s assets and liabilities must also be considered. As time progresses, the character 
of both assets (human capital) and liabilities changes.
Changing Human Capital
When asset allocation considers such extended portfolio assets as human capital, the optimal allocation of financial capital can change through time (Bodie, Merton, and Samuelson 1992). Assuming no change in the investor’s utility function, as human 4

Time Horizon 315
capital—with its predominately bond-like risk—declines over time, the asset allocation 
for financial capital would reflect an increasing allocation to bonds. This is a prime 
example of how time horizon can influence asset allocation.
Changing Character of Liabilities
The changing character of liabilities through time will also affect the asset allocation aligned to fund those liabilities.
As an example, the term structure of liabilities changes as they approach maturity. 
A pension benefit program is a simple way to illustrate this point. When the employee 
base is young and retirements are far into the future, the liability can be hedged 
with long-term bonds. As the employee base ages and prospective retirements are not so far into the future, the liability is more comparable to intermediate- or even short-term bonds. When retirements are imminent, the structure of the liabilities can be characterized as cash-like, and an optimal asset allocation would also have cash-like characteristics.
Similarly, the overall profile of an individual investor’s liabilities changes with 
the progression of time, particularly for investors with finite investment horizons. Nearer-term goals and liabilities move from partially funded to fully funded, while other, longer-term goals and liabilities move progressively closer to funding. As the relative weights of the goals to be funded shift and the time horizon associated with 
certain goals shortens, the aggregate asset allocation must be adapted if it is to remain 
aligned with the individual’s goals.
Time horizon is also likely to affect the manner in which an investor prioritizes 
certain goals and liabilities. This will influence the desired risk profile of the assets aligned to fund them. Consider a 75-year-old retired investor with two goals:
1.
 F
und consumption needs through age 95
2.
 F
und consumption needs from age 95 through age 105
He most likely assigns a much higher priority to funding goal 1, given the lower 
probability that he will live beyond age 95.3 Let’s also assume that he has sufficient 
assets to fund goal 1 and to partially fund goal 2. The higher priority assigned to goal 1 indicates he is less willing to take risk, and this sub-portfolio will be invested more 
conservatively. Now consider goal 2: Given the low probability of living past 95 and the 
fact that he does not currently have sufficient assets to fund that goal, the sub-portfolio 
assigned to goal 2 is likely to have a more growth-oriented asset allocation. The prior -
ity of a given goal can change as the investor’s time horizon shortens—or lengthens.
Consider the hypothetical investors Ivy and Charles Lee from the reading 
“Introduction to Asset Allocation. ” Ivy is a 54-year-old life science entrepreneur.

The lifestyle/consumption goal is split into three components: required minimum 
consumption requirements (a worst-case scenario of reduced lifestyle), baseline con-
sumption needs (maintaining current standard of living), and aspirational consumption 
needs (an improved standard of living). At age 54, the risk preferences assigned to 
these goals might look something like the following:
Lifestyle GoalsRisk

and cash100%
* The present value of each goal as a proportion of the total portfolio.
The asset allocation for the total portfolio aggregates the asset allocations for each 
of the goal-aligned sub-portfolios, weighted by the present value of each goal. For the Lees, this is an overall asset allocation of about 25% equities and 75% bonds and cash. (Each goal is discounted to its present value by expected return of its respective goal-aligned sub-portfolio.)
Move forward 20 years. The Lees are now in their mid-70s, and their life expec -
tancy is about 12 years. Their son has completed his college education and is suc -
cessfully established in his own career. The charitable gift has been made. These two goals have been realized. The assets needed to fund the baseline consumption goal are significantly reduced because fewer future consumption years need to be funded. The special needs trust for their granddaughter remains a high priority. Although the 
Lee’s risk preferences for these goals have not changed, the overall asset allocation will  
change because the total portfolio is an aggregated mix of the remaining goal-aligned 
sub-portfolios, weighted by their current present values:

* The present value of each goal as a proportion of the total portfolio. The implied assumption is that cur -
rent assets are sufficient to fund all goals, provided the Lees adopt an aggressive asset allocation strategy for the aspirational and charitable gifting goals. If the value of current assets exceeds the present value of all goals, the Lees would have greater flexibility to adopt a lower risk preference for some or all goals.
Although for ease of illustration our example assumed the Lee’s risk preferences 
remained the same, this is not likely to be the case in the real world. Required minimum 
and baseline consumption goals would remain very important; there is less flexibility to withstand losses caused by either reduced earnings potential or lower likelihood

of the market regaining lost ground within the shorter horizon. The aspirational 
lifestyle goal is likely to be a much lower priority, and it may have been eliminated 
altogether. The special needs trust may have a higher (or lower) priority as the needs 
of the granddaughter and the ability of her parents to provide for her needs after their 
death become more evident. The preferred asset allocation for each of these goals will 
shift over the course of the investor’s lifetime.
As an investor’s time horizon shifts, both human capital and financial market 
considerations, along with changes in the investor’s priorities, will most likely lead to different asset allocation decisions.
EXAMPLE 3
Time Horizon Constraints in Asset Allocation
1. Ak karat Aromdee, the recently retired President of Alpha Beverage, is 67 
years old with a remaining life expectancy of 15 years. Upon his retire-ment two years ago, he established a charitable foundation and funded it with THB600 million (≈ US$17.3 million). The remaining financial assets, THB350 million (≈ US$10 million), were transferred to a trust that will allow him to draw a lifetime income. The assets are invested 100% in fixed-income securities, consistent with Aromdee’s desire for a high level of certainty in meeting his goals. He is a widower with no children. His consumption needs are estimated at THB20 million annually. Assets remaining in the trust at his death will pass to the charities named in the trust.
While vacationing in Ko Samui, Aromdee met and later married a 45-year-
old woman with two teenage children. She has limited financial assets of her own. Upon returning from his honeymoon, Aromdee meets with his invest-ment adviser. He intends to pay the college expenses of his new stepchil-dren—THB2 million annually for eight years, beginning five years from now. He would also like to ensure that his portfolio can provide a modest lifetime income for his wife after his death.
Discuss how these changed circumstances are likely to influence Aromdee’s 
asset allocation.
Solution:
At the time Aromdee established the trust, the investment horizon was 15 years and his annual consumption expenditures could easily be funded from the trust. His desire to support his new family introduces two new horizons to be considered: In five years, the trust will begin making annual payments of THB2 million to fund college expenses, and the trust will continue to make distributions to his wife after his death, though at a reduced rate. When the trust needed to support only his consumption requirements, a conservative asset allocation was appropriate. However, the payment of college expenses will reduce his margin of safety and the lengthening of the investment horizon suggests that he should consider adding equity-oriented investments to the asset mix to provide for growth in assets over time.

TIME DIVERSIFICATION OF RISK
In practice, investors often align lower risk/lower return assets with short-term 
goals and liabilities and higher risk/higher return assets with long-term goals 
and liabilities. It is generally believed that longer-horizon goals can tolerate 
the higher volatility associated with higher risk/higher return assets as below average and above average returns even out over time. This is the notion of time diversification.
Mean–variance optimization, typically conducted using a multi-year time 
horizon, assumes that asset returns follow a random walk; returns in Year X 
are independent of returns in Year X − 1. Under this baseline assumption, there 
is no reduction in risk with longer time horizons.4 Although the probability of 
reduced wealth or of a shortfall in funding a goal or liability (based on the mean 
of the distribution of possible outcomes) may be lower at longer time horizons, 
the dispersion of possible outcomes widens as the investment horizon expands. 
Thus, the magnitude of potential loss or shortfall can be greater.
Consider the choice of investing US$100,000 in a Global Equity Index ETF 
with a 7.0% expected return and 15% standard deviation versus a risk-free asset with a 1.5% annual return. The table below compares the return of the risk-free asset over various time horizons, with the range of predicted returns for the S&P 500 Index fund at a 95% confidence interval. Although the mean  return of 
the distribution of S&P 500 returns exceeds that of the risk-free asset in each time period (thus the notion that the volatility of higher risk, higher return assets evens out over time), the lower boundary of expected S&P 500 returns is less than the initial investment for all periods less than 10 years! The lower boundary of the S&P 500 outcomes does not exceed the ending wealth of the risk-free investment until the investment horizon is extended to 30 years. If the 
confidence interval is expanded to 99%, the lower boundary of S&P 500 outcomes 
falls below the initial investment up until and through 20 years!
 
  Ending Wealth (US$)
  S&P 500  
95% Confidence Interval
Risk-Free Asset   Lower Boundary Upper Boundary
1 year 77,601 136,399 101,500
5 years 72,815 250,369 107,728
10 years 79,265 452,566 116,054
15 years 91,494 771,352 125,023
20 years 108,876 1,275,182 134,686
30 years 162,543 3,305,454 156,308
 
Although one-year returns are largely independent, there is some evidence that 
risky asset returns can display mean-reverting tendencies over intermediate to 
longer time horizons. An assumption of mean-reverting risky asset returns would 
support the conventional arguments for funding long-term goals and liabilities with higher risk/higher return assets, and it would also support a reduction in the allocation to these riskier assets as the time horizon shortens.

Regulatory and Other External Constraints 319
REGULATORY AND OTHER EXTERNAL CONSTRAINTS
discuss asset size, liquidity needs, time horizon, and regulatory or 
other considerations as constraints on asset allocation
Just as an integrated asset/liability approach to asset allocation is likely to result in a 
different allocation decision than what might have been selected in an asset-only con-
text, external considerations may also influence the asset allocation decision. Local laws 
and regulations can have a material effect on an investor’s asset allocation decisions. 
Pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and endowments 
and foundations are each subject to externally imposed constraints that are likely to tilt their asset allocation decision away from what may have been selected in a pure asset/liability context.
Insurance Companies
Unlike pension fund or endowment assets—which are legally distinct from the assets 
of the sponsoring entity—insurance companies’ investment activities are an integral part of their day-to-day operations. Although skilled underwriting may be the focus of the firm as the key to profitability, investment returns are often a material con-tributor to profits or losses. Regulatory requirements and accounting treatment vary from country to country, but insurers are most often highly focused on matching assets to the projected, probabilistic cash flows of the risks they are underwriting. Fixed-income assets, therefore, are typically the largest component of an insurance company’s asset base, and investing with skill in this asset class is a key to compet -
itive pricing and success. In some regions, the relevant accounting treatment may be a book value approach, rendering variability in the market pricing of assets to be a secondary consideration as long as an asset does not have to have its book value written down as “other than temporarily impaired” (“OTTI”). Risk considerations for an insurance company include the need for capital to pay policyholder benefits and 
other factors that directly influence the company’s financial strength ratings. Some of 
the key considerations are risk-based capital measures, yield, liquidity, the potential for 
forced liquidation of assets to fund negative claims development, and credit ratings.
Additionally, allocations to certain asset classes are often constrained by a regu-
lator. For example, the maximum limit on equity exposure is often 10%, but it ranges as high as 30% in Switzerland and 50% in Mexico. Israel and Korea impose a limit of 
15% on real estate investments.5 Restrictions on non-publicly traded securities might 
also limit the allocation to such assets as private equity, for example, and there may also be limits on the allocation to high-yield bonds. Insurance regulators generally set a minimum capital level for each insurer based on that insurer’s mix of assets, liabilities, and risk. Many countries are moving to Solvency II regulatory standards 
designed to harmonize risk-based capital requirements for insurance companies across 
countries.6 Asset classes are often treated differently for purposes of determining 
whether an insurer meets risk-based capital requirements.

Learning Module 5  A sset Allocation with Real-World Constraints 320
Pension Funds
Pension fund asset allocation decisions may be constrained by regulation and influ-
enced by tax rules.7 Some countries regulate maximum or minimum percentages in 
certain asset classes. For example, Japanese pension funds must hold a certain min-imum percentage of assets in Japanese bonds in order to maintain their tax-exempt status. Canada allows a maximum of 10% of market value invested in any one entity 
or related entities; Switzerland generally limits real estate investments to 30%; Estonia 
allows a maximum of 75% of assets invested in public equity with no limit on foreign 
investments; and Brazil allows a maximum of 70% in public equity with a maximum of 
10% in foreign public equity.8 Ukraine limits bond investments to no more than 40%.
Pension funds are also subject to a wide array of funding, accounting, reporting, 
and tax constraints that may influence the asset allocation decision. (For example, US public pension funding and public and corporate accounting rules favor equity 
investments—higher equity allocations support a higher discount rate—and thus 
lower pension cost. Loss recognition is deferred until later through the smoothing 
mechanism.) The plan sponsor’s appetite for risk is defined in part by these constraints, 
and the choice among asset allocation alternatives is often influenced by funding and 
financial statement considerations, such as the anticipated contributions, the volatility 
of anticipated contributions, or the forecasted pension expense or income under a given 
asset allocation scenario. The specific constraints vary by jurisdiction, and companies 
with plans in multiple jurisdictions must satisfy the rules and regulations of each jurisdiction while making sound financial decisions for the organization as a whole.
Exhibit 3 illustrates how funding considerations may affect the asset allocation 
decision. In this chart, risk is defined as the probability of contributions exceeding some threshold amount. In this case, the risk threshold is specified as the 95th per -
centile of the present value of contributions—that point on the distribution of possible 
contributions (using Monte Carlo simulation) where the plan sponsor can be 95% certain that contributions will not exceed that amount.
Assume that an allocation of 70% equities/30% aggregate bonds represents the 
most efficient portfolio for the plan sponsor’s desired level of risk in an asset optimi-zation framework. In Exhibit 3, we can see that the 70% equity/30% aggregate bond mix (Portfolio A) is associated with a present value (PV) of expected contributions of approximately US$51 million (y-axis) and a 95% confidence level that contributions will not exceed approximately US$275 million (x-axis)—Portfolio A in Exhibit 3. If the plan sponsor were to maintain the 70/30 asset mix but shift to longer-duration bonds (from aggregate to long bonds) to better match the duration of liabilities—
Portfolio D1 on Exhibit 3—the PV of expected contributions declines by approximately 
US$5 million and the 95% confidence threshold improves to approximately US$265 million. In fact, Portfolio D
1 results in nearly the lowest PV of contributions for this 
plan sponsor. (Note that the vertical axis is ordered from highest contributions at the bottom and lowest contributions at the top, consistent with the notion of lower contributions as a better outcome.)

Now consider Portfolio D2, 60% equities/40% long bonds. Reducing the equity exposure 
from 70% to 60% lowers the contribution risk significantly, with only marginally higher 
expected PV of contributions than Portfolio A. (A lower equity allocation implies a 
lower expected rate of return, which increases the PV of contributions. However, the lower equity allocation also reduces the probability that less-than-expected returns 
will lead to unexpectedly large contributions.) The sponsor that wishes to reduce 
contribution risk substantially is likely to give serious consideration to moving from Portfolio A to Portfolio D
2.
By iterating through various efficient frontiers using different definitions of risk, 
the sponsor is able to better understand the risk and reward trade-offs of alternative asset allocation choices. The regulatory or tax constraints on minimum and maxi-mum contributions, or on minimum required funded levels, or other values that are 
important to the plan sponsor, can be factored into the simulations so the sponsor can 
better understand how these constraints might affect the risk and reward trade-offs.
Endowments and Foundations
Endowments and foundations are often established with the expectation that they will 
exist in perpetuity and thus can invest with a long investment horizon. In addition, the 
sponsoring entity often has more flexibility over payments from the fund than does a 
pension plan sponsor or insurance company. As a result, endowments and foundations 
generally can adopt a higher-risk asset allocation than other institutions. However, two 
categories of externally imposed constraints may influence the asset allocation decisions 
of an endowment or foundation: tax incentives and credit-worthiness considerations.
 ■Tax incentives. Although some endowments and foundations—US public foundations and some Austrian and Asian foundations, for example—are not required to make minimum distributions, many countries provide tax benefits tied to certain minimum spending requirements. For example, a private foundation may be subject to a requirement that it make charitable

Learning Module 5  A sset Allocation with Real-World Constraints 322
expenditures equal to at least 5% of the market value of its assets each year 
or risk losing its tax-favored status. These spending requirements may be relaxed if certain types of socially responsible investments are made, which can, in turn, create a bias toward socially responsible investments for some endowments and foundations, irrespective of their merits in an asset alloca-tion context.
 ■Credit considerations. Although endowments and foundations typically have a very long investment horizon, sometimes external factors may restrict the level of risk-taking in the portfolio. For example, endowment or foun-dation assets are often used to support the balance sheet and borrowing capabilities of the university or the foundation organization. Lenders often require that the borrower maintain certain minimum balance sheet ratios. Therefore, the asset allocation adopted by the organization will consider the risks of breaking these bond covenants or otherwise negatively affecting the borrowing capabilities of the organization.
As an example, although a hospital foundation fund would normally have a long 
investment horizon and the ability to invest in less liquid asset classes, it might limit the allocation to illiquid assets in order to support certain liquidity and balance sheet metrics specified by its lender(s).
Sovereign Wealth Funds
Although every sovereign wealth fund (SWF) is unique with respect to its mission and objectives, some broad generalizations can be made with respect to the external constraints that may affect a fund’s asset allocation choices. In general, SWFs are government-owned pools of capital invested on behalf of the peoples of their states or countries, investing with a long-term orientation. They are not generally seeking to defease a set of liabilities or known obligations as is common with pension funds and, to a lesser extent, endowment funds.
The governing entities adopt regulations that constrain the opportunity set 
for asset allocation. For example, the Korean SWF KIC cannot invest in Korean 
won-denominated domestic assets;9 and the Norwegian SWF NBIM is not permitted 
to invest in any alternative asset class other than real estate, which is limited to no 
more than 7% of assets.10 Furthermore, as publicly owned entities, SWFs are typically 
subject to broad public scrutiny and tend to adopt a lower-risk asset allocation than 
might otherwise be considered appropriate given their long-term investment horizon 
in order to avoid reputation risk.
In addition to the broad constraints of asset size, liquidity, time horizon, and 
regulations, there may be cultural or religious factors that also constrain the asset 
allocation choices. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations 
are becoming increasingly important to institutional and individual investors alike. Sharia law, for example, prohibits investment in any business that has links to pork, 
alcohol, tobacco, pornography, prostitution, gambling, or weaponry, and it constrains 
investments in most businesses that operate on interest payments (like major Western 
banks and mortgage providers) and in businesses that transfer risk (such as major Western insurers).

Regulatory and Other External Constraints 323
ESG goals are not typically modeled during the asset allocation decision process. 
Instead, these goals may be achieved through the implementation of the asset alloca-
tion, or the asset owner may choose to set aside a targeted portion of the assets for these missions. The asset allocation process would treat this “set-aside” in much the same way that a concentrated stock position might be handled: The risk, return, and correlation characteristics of this holding are specified; the “set aside” asset becomes an asset class in the investor’s opportunity set; and the asset allocation constraints will designate a certain minimum investment in this asset class.
EXAMPLE 4
External Constraints and Asset Allocation
1. An insuranc e company has traditionally invested its pension plan using the 
asset allocation strategy adopted for its insurance assets: The pension assets are 95% invested in high-quality intermediate duration bonds and 5% in global equities. The duration of pension liabilities is approximately 25 years. Until now, the company has always made contributions sufficient to main-tain a fully funded status. Although the company has a strong capability to fund the plan adequately and a relatively high tolerance for variability in asset returns, as part of a refinement in corporate strategy, management is now seeking to reduce long-term expected future cash contributions. Man-agement is willing to accept more risk in the asset return, but they would like to limit contribution risk and the risk to the plan’s funded status. The Investment Committee is considering three asset allocation proposals for the pension plan:
A.
 Main
tain the current asset allocation with the same bond portfolio 
duration.
B. Inc
rease the equity allocation and lengthen the bond portfolio dura-
tion to increase the hedge of the duration risk in the liabilities.
C.
 Main
tain the current asset allocation of 95% bonds and 5% global 
equities, but increase the duration of bond investments.
Discuss the merits of each proposal.
Solution:
Given the intermediate duration bond allocation, Proposal A fails to consid-er the mismatch between pension assets and liabilities and risks a reduction in the funded status and increased contributions if bond yields decline. (If yields decline across the curve, the shorter duration bond portfolio will fail to hedge the increase in liabilities.) To meet the objective of lower future contributions, the asset allocation must include a higher allocation to equi-ties. Proposal B has this higher allocation, and the extension of duration in the bond portfolio in Proposal B reduces balance sheet and surplus risk rel-ative to the pension liabilities. The net effect could be a reduction in short-term contribution risk; moreover, if the greater expected return on equities is realized, it should result in reduced contributions to the plan over the long term. Proposal C improves the hedging of the liabilities, and it may result in a modest improvement in the expected return on assets if the yield curve is upward-sloping. However, the expected return on Proposal C is likely lower than the expected return of Proposal B and is therefore unlikely to achieve the same magnitude of reduction in future cash contributions. Proposal C

would be appropriate if the goal was focused on reducing surplus risk rather 
than reducing long-term contributions.
2.
 A m
ultinational corporation headquartered in Mexico has acquired a for-
mer competitor in the United States. It will maintain both the US pension plan with US$250 million in assets and the Mexican pension plan with MXN$18,600 million in assets (≈ US$1 billion). Both plans are 95% funded and have similar liability profiles. The Mexican pension trust has an asset al-location policy of 30% equities (10% invested in the Mexican equity market and 20% in equity markets outside Mexico), 10% hedge funds, 10% private equity, and 50% bonds. The treasurer has proposed that the company adopt a consistent asset allocation policy across all of the company’s pension plans worldwide.
Critique the treasurer’s proposal.
Solution:
The treasurer’s proposal fails to consider the relative asset size of the two 
pension plans as well as the likelihood that plans in different jurisdictions may be subject to different funding, regulatory, and financial reporting re-quirements. The US pension plan may be unable to effectively access certain alternative asset classes, such as private equity, infrastructure, and hedge funds. Although economies of scale may be realized if management of the pension assets is consolidated under one team, the legal and regulatory dif-ferences of the markets in which they operate mean that the asset allocation policy must be customized to each plan.
ASSET ALLOCATION FOR THE TAXABLE INVESTOR 
AND AFTER-TAX PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION
discuss tax considerations in asset allocation and rebalancing
Portfolio theory developed in a frictionless world. But in the real world, taxes on 
income and capital gains can erode the returns achieved by taxable investors. The asset owner who ignores taxes during the asset allocation process is overlooking an 
economic variable that can materially alter the outcome. Although tax adjustments can 
be made after the asset allocation has been determined, this is a suboptimal approach 
because the pre-tax and after-tax risk and return characteristics of each asset class can be materially different.
Some assets are less tax efficient than others because of the character of their 
returns—the contribution of interest, dividends, and realized or unrealized capital gains 
to the total return. Interest income is usually taxed in the tax year it is received, and it 
often faces the highest tax rates. Therefore, assets that generate returns largely com-
prised of interest income tend to be less tax efficient in many countries.12 Jurisdictional 
rules can also affect how the returns of certain assets are taxed. In the United States, for example, the interest income from state and local government bonds is generally

exempt from federal income taxation. As a result, these bonds often constitute a large 
portion of a US high-net-worth investor’s bond allocation. Preferred stocks, often used 
in lieu of bonds as an income-producing asset, are also eligible for more favorable 
tax treatment in many jurisdictions, where the income from preferred shares may be taxed at more favorable dividend tax rates.
The tax environment is complex. Different countries have different tax rules and 
rates, and these rules and rates can change frequently. However, looking across the 
major economies, there are some high-level commonalities in how investment returns 
are taxed. Interest income is taxed typically (but not always) at progressively higher 
income tax rates. Dividend income and capital gains are taxed typically (but not 
always) at lower tax rates than those applied to interest income and earned income (wages and salaries, for example). Capital losses can be used to offset capital gains (and sometimes income). Generally, interest income incurs the highest tax rate, with dividend income taxed at a lower rate in some countries, and long-term capital gains 
receive the most favorable tax treatment in many jurisdictions. Once we move beyond 
these general commonalities, however, the details of tax treatment among countries quickly diverge.
Entities and accounts can be subject to different tax rules. For example, retire-
ment savings accounts may be tax deferred or tax exempt, with implications for the 
optimal asset allocation solution. These rules provide opportunities for strategic asset 
location—placing less tax-efficient assets in tax-advantaged accounts.
We will provide a general framework for considering taxes in asset allocation. We 
will not survey global tax regimes or incorporate all potential tax complexities into the 
asset allocation solution. When considering taxes in asset allocation, the objective is 
to model material investment-related taxes, thereby providing a closer approximation 
to economic reality than is represented when ignoring taxes altogether.
For simplicity, we will assume a basic tax regime that represents no single country 
but includes the key elements of investment-related taxes that are roughly represen-tative of what a typical taxable asset owner in the major developed economies must contend with.
After-Tax Portfolio Optimization
After-tax portfolio optimization requires adjusting each asset class’s expected return and risk for expected tax. The expected after-tax return is defined in Equation 1:
 rat = rpt(1 − t)   (1)
wher
e
 
rat = the expected after-tax return
 
rpt = the expected pre-tax (gross) return
 
t = the expected tax rate
This can be straightforward for bonds in cases where the expected return is driven by interest income. Take, for example, an investment-grade par bond with a 3% cou-pon expected to be held to maturity. If interest income is subject to a 40% expected tax rate, the bond has an expected after-tax return of 1.80% [0.03(1 − 0.40) = 0.018].
The expected return for equity typically includes both dividend income and price 
appreciation (capital gains). Equation 2 expands Equation 1 accordingly:
 rat = pdrpt(1 − td) + parpt(1 − tcg)   (2)

where
 
pd = the proportion of rpt attributed to dividend income
 
pa = the proportion of rpt attributed to price appreciation
 
td = the dividend tax rate
 
tcg = the capital gains tax rate
The treatment of the capital gains portion of equity returns can be more complex. 
Assuming no dividend income, a stock with an 8% expected pre-tax return that is 
subject to a 25% capital gains tax rate has an expected after-tax return of 6% [0.08(1 − 0.25) = 0.06]. This is an approximation satisfactory for modeling purposes.
13
Taxable assets may have existing unrealized capital gains or losses (i.e., the cost 
basis is below or above market value), which come with embedded tax liabilities (or tax assets). Although there is not a clear consensus on how best to deal with existing unrealized capital gains (losses), many approaches adjust the asset’s current market value for the value of the embedded tax liability (asset) to create an after-tax value. Reichenstein (2006) approximates the after-tax value by subtracting the value of the embedded capital gains tax from the market value, as if the asset were sold today. Horan and Al Zaman (2008) assume the asset is sold in the future and discount the tax liability to its present value using the asset’s after-tax return as the discount rate. 
Turvey, Basu, and Verhoeven (2013) argue that the after-tax risk-free rate is the 
more appropriate discount rate because the embedded tax liability is analogous to an 
interest-free loan from the government, where the tax liability can be arbitraged away 
by dynamically investing in the risk-free asset. We will discuss how to incorporate 
after-tax values into the portfolio optimization process in Section 7, where we address 
strategies to reduce the impact of taxes.
The ultimate purpose of an asset can be a consideration when modeling tax 
adjustments. In the preceding material on asset allocation, we discussed goals-based investing. If the purpose of a given pool of assets is to fund consumption in 10 years, then that 10-year holding period may influence the estimated implied annual capital gains tax rate. If the purpose of the specified pool of assets is to fund a future gift of appreciated stock to a tax-exempt charity, then capital gains tax may be ignored alto-gether. Through this alignment of goals with assets, goals-based investing facilitates more-precise tax adjustments.
Although correlation assumptions need not be adjusted when modeling asset allo -
cation choices for the taxable asset owner (taxes are proportional to return, after-tax co-movements are the same as pre-tax co-movements), taxes do affect the standard deviation assumption for each asset class. The expected after-tax standard deviation is defined in Equation 3:
 σat = σpt(1 − t)   (3)
wher
e
 
σat = the expected after-tax standard deviation
 
σpt = the expected pre-tax standard deviation
Taxes alter the distribution of returns by both reducing the expected mean return 
and muting the dispersion of returns. Taxes truncate both the high and low ends of the distribution of returns, resulting in lower highs and higher lows. The effect of taxes is intuitive when considering a positive return, but the same economics apply 
13 A more precise estimation of the expected after-tax return also takes into account the effect of the holding period on the capital gains tax. For those interested in a more detailed discussion of these issues, see Mladina (2011).

Asset Allocation for the Taxable Investor and After-Tax Portfolio Optimization 327
to a negative return: Losses are muted by the same (1 − t ) tax adjustment. The inves -
tor is not taxed on losses but instead receives the economic benefit of a capital loss, 
whether realized or not. In many countries, a realized capital loss can offset a current 
or future realized capital gain. An unrealized capital loss captures the economic benefit 
of a cost basis that is above the current market value, making a portion of expected 
future appreciation tax free.
How does the optimal asset allocation along a pre-tax efficient frontier compare 
with the optimal asset allocation along an after-tax efficient frontier? Let’s assume all investment assets are taxable and that cost bases equal current market values. Assume also that interest income is taxed at 40%, and dividend income and capital gains are taxed at 25%.
The asset classes we will consider include investment-grade (IG) bonds, high-yield 
(HY) bonds, and equity. Exhibit 4 shows the expected pre-tax returns and standard deviations for each asset class as well as the correlation matrix. Note that for ease of illustration, we have assumed that the IG bonds and HY bond returns are comprised of 100% interest income. In practice, some portion of the expected return would be eligible for capital gains tax treatment.

In Exhibit 8, we compare the pre-tax and after-tax efficient frontiers from these pre-
vious exhibits. Note that the portfolios at either extreme (P1 and P100) are essentially 
unchanged after taxes are factored into the assumptions. In portfolios P25, P50, and 
P75, however, you can see a significant reduction in the allocation to high-yield bonds. 
This is because of the heavier tax burden imposed on high-yield bonds. Although 
investment-grade bonds receive the same tax treatment, they are less risky than 
high-yield bonds and demonstrate a lower correlation with equity, so they continue to play the important role of portfolio risk reduction.

The optimal after-tax asset allocation depends on the interaction of after-tax returns, 
after-tax risk, and correlations. If an asset class or strategy is tax inefficient, it can still play a diversifying role in an optimal after-tax asset allocation if the asset or 
strategy offers sufficiently low correlations. After-tax portfolio optimization helps 
answer that question.

Taxes and Portfolio Rebalancing 329
TAXES AND PORTFOLIO REBALANCING
discuss tax considerations in asset allocation and rebalancing
Among tax-exempt institutional asset owners, periodic portfolio rebalancing—  r eallocating 
assets to return the portfolio to its target strategic asset allocation—is an integral part 
of sound portfolio management. This is no less true for taxable asset owners, but with 
the important distinction that more frequent rebalancing exposes the taxable asset 
owner to realized taxes that could have otherwise been deferred or even avoided. 
Whereas the tax burden incurred by liquidating assets to fund-required consumption 
cannot be avoided, rebalancing is discretionary; thus, the taxable asset owner should consider the trade-off between the benefits of tax minimization and the merits of maintaining the targeted asset allocation by rebalancing. The decision to rebalance and incur taxes is driven by each asset owner’s unique circumstances.
Because after-tax volatility is less than pre-tax volatility (Equation 3) and asset 
class correlations remain the same, it takes larger asset class movements to materially 
alter the risk profile of the taxable portfolio. This suggests that rebalancing ranges for a taxable portfolio can be wider than those of a tax-exempt portfolio with a similar risk profile.
For example, consider a portfolio with a 50% allocation to equity, where equity 
returns are subject to a 25% tax rate. A tax-exempt investor may establish a target allo -
cation to equities of 50%, with an acceptable range of 40% to 60% (50% plus or minus 10%). A taxable investor with the same target equity allocation can achieve a similar risk constraint with a range of 37% to 63% (50% plus or minus 13%). The equivalent rebalancing range for the taxable investor is derived by adjusting the permitted 10% deviation (up or down) by the tax rate, as shown in Equation 4:
 Rat=Rpt/(1 − t)   (4)
wher
e
 
Rat = the after-tax rebalancing range
 
Rpt = the pre-tax rebalancing range
In our example, the 10% rebalancing range for a tax-exempt investor becomes a 
13.3% rebalancing range for a taxable investor (when ranges are viewed and monitored 
from the same gross return perspective):
 0.10/(1 
− 0.25) = 13.3%
Broader rebalancing ranges for the taxable investor reduce the frequency of trading 
and, consequently, the amount of taxable gains.
Strategies to Reduce Tax Impact
Additional strategies can be used to reduce taxes, including tax-loss harvesting and choices in the placement of certain types of assets in taxable or tax-exempt accounts 
(strategic asset location). Tax-loss harvesting is intentionally trading to realize a capital 
loss, which is then used to offset a current or future realized capital gain in another part of the portfolio, thereby reducing the taxes owned by the investor. It is discussed elsewhere in the curriculum, but we address strategic asset location strategies here.
Strategic asset location refers to placing (or locating) less tax-efficient assets in 
accounts with more favorable tax treatment, such as retirement savings accounts.7

Learning Module 5  A sset Allocation with Real-World Constraints 330
Aggregating assets across accounts with differing tax treatment requires modi-
fying the asset value inputs to the portfolio optimization. Assets held in tax-exempt  
accounts require no tax adjustment to their market values. Assets in tax-deferred  
accounts grow tax free but are taxed upon distribution. Because these assets cannot 
be distributed (and consumed) without incurring the tax, the tax burden is insepa-rable from the economic value of the assets. Thus, the after-tax value of assets in a tax-deferred account is defined by Equation 5:
 vat = vpt(1 − ti)   (5)
wher
e
 
vat = the after-tax value of assets
 
vpt = the pre-tax market value of assets
 
ti = the expected income tax rate upon distribution
In our earlier example, we had three asset classes: investment-grade bonds, 
high-yield bonds, and equities. If we assume that each of these three asset classes can 
be held in either of two account types—taxable or tax-deferred—then our optimization 
uses six different after-tax asset classes (three asset classes times two account types). The three asset classes in taxable accounts use the after-tax return and risk inputs derived earlier. The three asset classes in tax-deferred accounts (which grow tax free) 
use expected pre-tax return and risk inputs. The optimization adds constraints based 
on the after-tax value of the assets currently available in each account type and derives 
the optimal after-tax asset allocation and asset location simultaneously.
As a general rule, the portion of a taxable asset owner’s assets that are eligible 
for lower tax rates and deferred capital gains tax treatment should first be allocated to the investor’s taxable accounts. For example, equities should generally be held in taxable accounts, while taxable bonds and high-turnover trading strategies should generally be located in tax-exempt and tax-deferred accounts to the extent possible.
One important exception to this general rule regarding asset location applies 
to assets held for near-term liquidity needs. Because tax-exempt and tax-deferred accounts may not be immediately accessible without tax penalty, a portion of the bond allocation may be held in taxable accounts if its role is to fund near-term con-sumption requirements.
EXAMPLE 5
Asset Allocation and the Taxable Investor
Sarah Moreau, 45 years old, is a mid-level manager at a consumer products company. Her investment portfolio consists entirely of tax-deferred retirement savings accounts. Through careful savings and investments, she is on track to accumulate sufficient assets to retire at age 60. Her portfolio is currently allo-cated as indicated below:
 
Investment-grade bonds 20%
High-yield bonds 20%
Common stock–dividend income strategy 30%
Common stock–total return (capital gain) strategy 30%
Total portfolio 100%
 
The common stock–dividend income strategy focuses on income-oriented, 
high-dividend-paying stocks; the common stock–total return strategy focuses on 
stocks that represent good, long-term opportunities but pay little to no dividend.

Taxes and Portfolio Rebalancing 331
For the purposes of this example, we will assume that the expected long-term 
return is equivalent between the two strategies. Moreau has a high comfort level 
with this portfolio and the overall level of risk it entails.
Moreau has recently inherited additional monies, doubling her investable 
assets. She intends to use this new, taxable portfolio to support causes important 
to her personally over her lifetime. There is no change in her risk tolerance. She 
is interviewing prospective investment managers and has asked each to recom-mend an asset allocation strategy for the new portfolio using the same set of asset classes. She has received the following recommendations:
 
  Recommendation
  A B C
Investment-grade bonds 20% 40% 30%
High-yield bonds 20% 0% 0%
Common stock–dividend income strategy 30% 30% 0%
Common stock–total return (capital gain) 
strategy30% 30% 70%
Total portfolio 100% 100% 100%
 
1. Whic h asset allocation is most appropriate for the new portfolio? Justify 
your response.
Solution:
Recommendation C would be the most appropriate asset allocation for the 
new portfolio. The high-yield bond and common stock–dividend income strategies are tax disadvantaged in a taxable portfolio. (Although invest-ment-grade bonds are also tax disadvantaged, they maintain the role of controlling portfolio risk to maintain Moreau’s risk preference.) By shifting this equity-like risk to the total return common stock strategy, Moreau should achieve a greater after-tax return. Given the lower standard deviation characteristics of after-tax equity returns when held in the taxable portfolio, a higher allocation to common stocks may be justified without exceeding Moreau’s desired risk level. Recommendations A and B do not consider the negative tax implications of holding the high-yield and/or common stock–dividend income strategies in a taxable portfolio. Recommendation B also fails to consider Moreau’s overall risk tolerance: The volatility of the com-mon stock–capital gain strategy is lower when held in a taxable portfolio, thus a higher allocation to this strategy can enhance returns while remaining within Moreau’s overall risk tolerance.

2. H ow should Moreau distribute these investments among her taxable and 
tax-exempt accounts?
Solution:
If Moreau is willing to think of her investable portfolio as a single portfolio, rather than as independent “retirement” and “important causes” portfolios, she should hold the allocation to high-yield bonds and dividend-paying 
14 In vestment-grade bonds also have lower after-tax volatility. The equivalent risk portfolios in pre-tax and 
after-tax environments are a function of a complex interaction of after-tax returns, standard deviations, and correlations.

stocks in her tax-exempt retirement portfolio. In addition, subject to the 
overall volatility of the individual tax-exempt and taxable portfolios, it would be sensible to bear any increased stock risk in the taxable portfolio. A new optimization for all  of Moreau’s assets—using pre-tax and after-tax risk 
and return assumptions and subject to the constraint that half of the assets are held in a taxable portfolio and half are held in the tax-exempt portfolio—would more precisely allocate investments across portfolio (account) types.

3. Y ou are a member of the Investment Committee for a multinational cor-
poration, responsible for the supervision of two portfolios. Both portfolios were established to fund retirement benefits: One is a tax-exempt defined benefit pension fund, and the other is taxable, holding assets intended to fund non-exempt retirement benefits. The pension fund has a target allocation of 70% equities and 30% fixed income, with a +/− 5% rebalancing range. There is no formal asset allocation policy for the taxable portfolio; it has simply followed the same allocation adopted by the pension portfolio. Because of recent strong equity market returns, both portfolios are now allocated 77% to equities and 23% to bonds. Management expects that the equity markets will continue to produce strong returns in the near term. Staff has offered the following options for rebalancing the portfolios:
Which recommendation is most appropriate? Justify your response.
A.
 D
o not rebalance.
B. Re
balance both portfolios to the 70% equity/30% fixed-income target 
allocation.
C.
 Re
balance the tax-exempt portfolio to the 70% equity/30% fixed-in-
come target allocation, but expand the rebalancing range for the 
taxable portfolio.
Solution:
Recommendation C is the most appropriate course of action. Rebalancing of the tax-exempt portfolio is unencumbered by tax considerations, and rebalancing maintains the desired level of risk. The rebalancing range for the taxable portfolio can be wider than that of the tax-exempt portfolio based on the desire to minimize avoidable taxes and the lower volatility of after-tax equity returns. Recommendation A (no rebalancing) does not address the increased level of risk in the tax-exempt portfolio that results from the increase in the stock allocation. Recommendation B would create an unnecessary tax liability for the company, given that the portfolio is still operating in a reasonable range of risk when adjusted for taxes.

Taxes and Portfolio Rebalancing 333
INCREASING ALLOCATIONS TO FIXED INCOME IN CORPORATE PENSION 
PLANS
Increasing allocations to fixed income by defined benefit pension funds world-
wide have been driven largely by a desire to better hedge plan liabilities. In some 
countries, accounting standards discourage de-risking. De-risking, however, is not the only argument in favor of a higher fixed-income allocation.
De-risking
There has been much discussion globally of pension plans “de-risking”—moving 
toward larger fixed-income allocations to better hedge liabilities, thereby reduc -
ing contribution uncertainty. Some countries’ accounting rules, however—most 
notably those in the United States—discourage companies from moving in that 
direction. Under US GAAP accounting rules, for example, a higher allocation to 
equities allows the plan sponsor to employ a higher return assumption, thereby 
reducing pension cost, a non-cash expense that directly affects reported income.
For underfunded pension plans, de-risking leads to higher pension contribu -
tions. If a company has a weak core business with a higher-than-average proba-bility of going bankrupt and makes only the minimum required contribution, it might be argued that the asset allocation decision was contrary to the interests 
of plan participants. If the company were to go bankrupt, the participants would 
get only the benefits covered by any government guaranty program. Had the company taken equity risk in the plan, there would have been a possibility of closing the funding gap, resulting in higher benefit payments.
Efficient Allocation of Risk
A higher allocation to fixed income—and a lower allocation to equity—might also 
be driven by corporate governance considerations. Pension investment activities 
are not a core competency of many companies, especially non-financial compa -
nies. Assuming that the company has a limited appetite for risk, shareholders 
might prefer that management allocate its risk budget to the core business of the 
company where they are expected to have skill, rather than to the pension fund. 
The rewards per unit of risk should presumably be greater in the company’s core 
business, and the improved profitability should offset the increase in pension contributions required as a result of the lower equity allocation.
A Holistic Approach to Asset Location
Finally, some have argued that an asset allocation of 100% fixed-income secu-rities can be justified on the premise that the company is acting as an agent for the benefit of all stakeholders, including shareholders and plan participants. This argument centers on tax-efficient asset location. A taxable investor—the shareholder and plan participant—should prefer to take his long-term equity risk in that portion of his overall portfolio where he will receive the benefit of lower capital gains rates rather than in tax-deferred accounts, the proceeds of which will be taxed at income tax rates. Consider a small business owner with US$3 million in total assets. The assets are split between a pension fund of which he is the sole participant (US$1 million) and a taxable portfolio (US$2 million). Assume that the asset allocation that represents his preferred level of risk is 67% equities and 33% fixed income. Where should this individual hold his equity exposure? As discussed, the more favorable tax treatment of equity returns argues for holding the equity exposure in his taxable account, while the

investments subject to the higher tax rate should be held in the tax-deferred 
account—the pension plan. Theoretically, this tax efficiency argument can be extended to pension funds operated by publicly traded companies.
15
REVISING THE STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION
recommend and justify revisions to an asset allocation given change(s) in investment objectives and/or constraints
An asset owner’s strategic asset allocation is not a static decision. Circumstances often 
arise that justify revisiting the original decision, either to confirm its appropriateness or 
to consider a change to the current allocation strategy. It is sound financial practice to 
periodically re-examine the asset allocation strategy even in the absence of one of the 
external factors discussed next. Many institutional asset owners typically re-visit the asset allocation policy at least once every five years through a formal asset allocation study, and all asset owners should affirm annually that the asset allocation remains appropriate given their needs and circumstances.
The circumstances that might trigger a special review of the asset allocation policy 
can generally be classified as relating to a change in goals , a change in constraints, 
or a change in beliefs. Among the reasons to review the strategic asset allocation are the following:
Goals
 ■Changes in business conditions affecting the organization supporting the fund and, therefore, expected changes in the cash flows
 ■A change in the investor’s personal circumstances that may alter her risk appetite or risk capacity
Over an individual’s lifespan, or throughout the course of an institutional fund’s lifes -
pan, it is unlikely that the investment goals and objectives will remain unchanged. An 
individual may get married, have children, or become disabled, for example, each of which may have implications for the asset allocation strategy.
Significant changes in the core business of an organization supporting or bene-
fiting from the trust might prompt a re-examination of the asset allocation strategy. 
For example, an automobile manufacturer that has historically generated a significant 
portion of its revenues from its consumer finance activities may find that technology 
is disrupting this source of revenue as more online tools become available to car 
buyers. With greater uncertainty in its revenue stream, company management may move to reduce risk-taking in the pension fund in order to achieve a goal of reducing the variability in year-to-year contributions.
A university may embark on a long-term capital improvement plan that is reliant 
on the endowment fund for financial support. Or the university may be experiencing 
declining enrollments and must lean more heavily on the endowment fund to support 
15 F or those interested in a more detailed discussion of this concept, see “The Case against Stock in 
Public Pension Funds” (Bader and Gold 2007) or the UBS Q-Series article, “Pension Fund Asset Allocation” 
(Cooper and Bianco 2003).8

Revising the Strategic Asset Allocation 335
its ongoing operational expenditures. The source of funds to a sovereign wealth fund 
may shrink considerably or even evaporate. When any of these, or similar, events occur or are anticipated, the existing asset allocation policy should be re-evaluated.
Constraints
A material change in any one of the constraints mentioned earlier—time horizon, liquidity needs, asset size, or regulatory or other external constraints—is also rea-son to re-examine the existing asset allocation policy. Some of these changes might include the following:
 ■Changes in the expected payments from the fund
 ■A significant cash inflow or unanticipated expenditure
 ■Changes in regulations governing donations or contributions to the fund
 ■Changes in time horizon resulting from the adoption of a lump sum distri-bution option at retirement
 ■Changes in asset size as a result of the merging of pension plans
Changes in the expected payments from the fund can materially affect the asset 
allocation strategy. For example, a university reduces its spending policy from 5% to 4% of assets annually; an individual retires early, perhaps for health reasons or an involuntary late-career layoff; or a US corporate pension sponsor reduces or freezes pension benefits because it can no longer afford increasing Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
16 premiums. Faced with lower payouts, the university endowment may 
have greater latitude to invest in less liquid segments of the market. Decisions as to how and where to invest given this greater flexibility should be made within the framework of an asset allocation study to ensure the resulting allocation achieves the optimal trade-off of risk and return.
Similarly, a significant cash inflow has the potential to materially affect the asset 
allocation strategy. If a university endowment fund with £500 million in assets receives 
a gift of £100 million, the new monies could be invested in parallel with the existing assets, but that fails to consider the increased earning potential of the fund and any 
spending requirements associated with the donation. Pausing to formally reassess the 
fund’s goals, objectives, constraints, and opportunities through an asset allocation study allows the asset owner to consider more broadly how best to maximize this additional wealth.
A change in regulations may also give rise to a change in asset allocation policy. 
Examples of regulatory changes that could trigger a re-examination of the asset allo-cation include the following:
 ■Regulatory changes in the United States in 2006 mandated a change in the liability discount rate, which resulted in larger pension contributions. With higher required contributions, there was less need to reach for higher investment returns. Many US corporate pension plans began de-risking (adopting an asset allocation strategy focused on hedging the liabilities) to reduce contribution volatility.
 ■UK tax incentives (30% of social impact investment costs can be deducted from income tax) and relaxed regulations for institutional investors were instituted to encourage socially responsible (impact) investing.
Again, an asset allocation study to objectively evaluate the effect of these changes 
on the investment opportunity set can help ensure that any new investment strategies 
adopted are consistent with the fund’s overarching goals and objectives.

Beliefs
Investment beliefs are a set of guiding principles that govern the asset owner’s 
investment activities. Beliefs are not static, however, and changes in the economic 
environment and capital market expectations or a change in trustees or committee members are two factors that may lead to an altering of the principles that guide investment activities.
17
An integral aspect of any asset allocation exercise is the forecasting of expected 
returns, volatilities, and correlations of the asset classes in the opportunity set. It fol-lows, then, that a material change in the outlook for one or more of the asset classes may heavily influence the asset allocation outcome.
Consider the 2015–2016 environment relative to the environment that prevailed 
in 1984–2014. The 1984–2014 investing environment was characterized by declin-ing inflation and interest rates (from the extraordinarily high levels of the 1970s and early 1980s); strong global GDP growth, aided by favorable demographics; gains in 
productivity; and rapid growth in China. Corporate profit growth was extremely 
robust, reflecting revenue growth from new markets, declining corporate taxes over the period, and improved efficiencies. Despite increased market turbulence, returns on US and Western European equities and bonds during the past 30 years were con-siderably higher than the long-run trend.
The environment of 2015–2016 was much less favorable for investors. The dra-
matic decline in inflation and interest rates ended, and labor force expansion and productivity gains stalled, with negative implications for GDP growth. The largest developed-country companies that generated much of the profits of the past 30 years were faced with competitive pressures as emerging-market companies expanded and technology advances changed the competitive landscape. In April 2016, McKinsey 
Global Institute published a projection of stocks and bonds under two growth 
scenarios—a slow growth scenario and a moderate growth scenario (Exhibit 9). In 
neither instance do the expected returns of the next 30 years come close to the returns 
of the past 30 years.18 Clearly, an asset allocation developed in 2010 built on return 
expectations based on the prior 26 years would look materially different than an asset 
allocation developed using more current, forward-looking return assumptions.

Asset returns and future return expectations shifted widely at the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and during the following period. Unlike in the case of other economic and financial crises, the causes of the pandemic-related turmoil were out -
side of the economic and financial system; yet, lockdowns and the sudden stop of economic activities led to a recession. The unemployment rate in the United States 
jumped from 3.5% to 14.7% between February 2021 and April 2021, and the June 2020 
annual real GDP growth was –9.1%—extreme numbers not observed since the Great Depression. Equity markets’ peak to trough period lasted for about a month: From February through March 2020, the global equity (MSCI ACWI) index fell by 34%, high-yield bonds lost about 21%, and oil prices fell by more than 60%. At the same time, governments and central banks came to the rescue with unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli. The 10-year Treasury rate fluctuated around as low as 0.6% in 
the United States from March through August 2020, and equities posted a very strong 
recovery for the rest of the year (the MSCI ACWI global equity index was at +70.5% from 23 March 2020 to 31 December 2020). 
While short-term market returns resembled a very wild roller coaster in 2020, 
long-term return expectations did not change that dramatically. Of course, bond return 
expectations became lower as a result of very low government yield levels due to the 
monetary stimulus, but it has been a general expectation that corporate earnings would 
recover as the disruptive impacts of the pandemic decline over time. Since the end of 
2021, however, policymakers and market participants have been trying to get a better 
understanding of the long lasting impacts of the pandemic: Inflation, among others, is 
one of the most topical issues. The unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli, supply 
chain disruptions, and changes in many people’s life style (working from home versus 
the office) may cause sticky price rises in certain segments of the economy.

Finally, as new advisers or members join the Investment Committee, they bring 
their own beliefs and biases regarding certain investment activities. Conducting an 
asset allocation study to educate these new members of the oversight group and 
introduce them to the investment philosophy and process that has been adopted by 
the organization will smooth their integration into the governance system and ensure 
that they have a holistic view of the asset owner’s goals and objectives.
In some instances, a change to an asset allocation strategy may reasonably be 
implemented without a formal asset allocation study. Certain milestones are reasonable 
points at which to implement a change in the policy, in most instances, reducing the 
level of risk. (For pension funds, these “milestones” are typically related to changes in 
the plan’s funded status.) Anticipating these milestones by putting an asset allocation 
policy in place that anticipates these changes allows the investor to respond more quickly to changing circumstances and in a non-reactive and objective manner. This 
rebalancing policy is frequently referred to as a “glide path. ” Target-date mutual funds 
common in retirement investing for individuals are one example of this approach to asset allocation. Exhibit 10 illustrates one fund company’s approach to migrating the asset allocation away from equities and towards bonds as retirement approaches.

In an institutional framework, the Investment Committee may specify certain funding 
levels it seeks to achieve. At the start of the period, an underfunded pension plan might adopt a higher equity allocation in an attempt to reduce the underfunding. If this is successful, the plan becomes better funded and there is less of a desire or need to take the higher level of equity risk. A pension fund may quickly implement “pre-programmed” asset allocation changes as the funded status of a pension plan 
improves. Typically, these planned reallocations are spelled out in an Investment 
Policy Statement.

Revising the Strategic Asset Allocation 339
EXAMPLE 6
Revising the Strategic Asset Allocation
Auldberg University Endowment Fund (AUE) has assets totaling CAF$200 
million. The current asset allocation is as follows:
 ■CAF$100 million in domestic equities
 ■CAF$60 million in domestic government debt
 ■CAF$40 million in Class B office real estate
AUE has historically distributed to the University 5% of the 36-month moving 
average of net assets, contributing approximately CAF$10 million of Auldberg 
University’s CAF$60 million annual operating budget. Real estate income (from 
the University’s CAF$350 million direct investment in domestic commercial real 
estate assets, including office buildings and industrial parks, much of it near the 
campus) and provincial subsidies have been the main source of income to the 
University. Admission is free to all citizens who qualify academically.
Growth in the Caflandia economy has been fueled by low interest rates, 
encouraging excess real estate development. There is a strong probability that 
the economy will soon go into recession, negatively impacting both the property 
values and the income potential of the University’s real estate holdings.
Gizi Horvath, a University alumna, has recently announced an irrevocable 
CAF$200 million gift to AUE, to be paid in equal installments over the next five 
years. AUE employs a well-qualified staff with substantial diverse experience in equities, fixed income, and real estate. Staff has recommended that the gift from Ms. Horvath be invested using the same asset allocation policy that the 
endowment has been following successfully for the past five years. They suggest 
that the asset allocation policy should be revisited once the final installment has been received.

 Cr
itique staff’s recommendation, and identify the case facts that support 
your critique.
Solution:
The size of the anticipated contributions will double AUE’s assets over the 
next five years, potentially increasing the opportunity set of asset classes suitable for their investment program. Given that a typical asset alloca-tion study encompasses a long investment horizon—10 years, 20 years, or more—staff should begin to evaluate the opportunities available to them to-day in anticipation of the future cash flows. Given the material change in the economic balance sheet along with changes in the asset size, liquidity, and time horizon constraints, AUE should plan on a regular, more frequent, for-mal review of the asset allocation policy until the situation stabilizes. The as-set allocation study should explore the feasibility of adding new asset classes as well as the ability to improve diversification within existing categories, perhaps by including non-domestic equities and bonds. Furthermore, the forecast economic environment may materially alter the outflows from the fund in support of the University’s day-to-day operations. Cash flows from the University’s real estate holdings are likely to decline, as are the values of those real estate assets. Given the outlook for real estate, a strong case can be made to limit or reduce the endowment’s investment in real estate; more-over, consideration should be given to the effect of declining income from the current real estate investment.

2. The G overnment Petroleum Fund of Caflandia (GPFC) is operating under 
the following asset allocation policy, which was developed with a 20-year 
planning horizon. Target weights and actual weights are given:
 
  Target Asset 
AllocationCurrent Asset 
Allocation
Global equities 30% 38%
Global high-yield bonds 10% 15%
Domestic intermediate bonds 30% 25%
Hedge funds 15% 15%
Private equity 15% 7%
 
When this asset allocation policy was adopted 5 years ago, the petroleum revenues that support the sovereign wealth fund were projected to contin-ue to grow for at least the next 25 years and intergenerational distributions were expected to begin in 20 years. However, since the adoption of this policy, alternate fuel sources have eroded both the price and quantity of oil exports, the economy is undergoing significant restructuring, inflows to the fund have been suspended, and distributions are expected to begin within 5 years.
What are the implications of this change in the liquidity constraints for the 
current asset allocation policy?
Solution:
GPFC had adopted a long-range asset allocation policy under the expecta-tion of continuing net cash inflows and no immediate liquidity constraints. With the change in circumstances, the need for liquidity in the fund has increased significantly. The current asset allocation policy allocates 40% of the fund’s assets to less liquid asset classes—high-yield bonds, hedge funds, and private equity. Although the allocation to private equity has not been fully implemented, the fund is overweight high-yield bonds and at the target weight for hedge funds. These asset classes—or the size of the allocation to these asset classes—may no longer be appropriate for the fund given the change in circumstances.

 O-C
hem Corp has a defined benefit pension plan with US$1.0 billion in 
assets. The plan is closed, the liabilities are frozen, and the plan is currently 65% funded. The company intends to increase cash contributions to improve the funded status of the plan and then purchase annuities to fully address all of the plan’s pension obligations. As part of an asset allocation analysis con-ducted every five years, the company has recently decided to allocate 80% of assets to liability-matching bonds and the remaining 20% to a mix of global equities and real estate. An existing private equity portfolio is in the midst of being liquidated. This allocation reflects a desired reduction in the level of investment risk.
O-Chem has just announced an ambitious US$15 billion capital investment 
program to build new plants for refining and production. The CFO in-formed the Pension Committee that the company will be contributing to the plan only the minimum funding required by regulations for the foreseeable future. It is estimated that achieving fully funded status for the pension plan

under minimum funding requirements and using the current asset alloca-
tion approach will take at least 10 years.
What are the implications of this change in funding policy for the pension 
plan’s asset allocation strategy?
Solution:
The Investment Committee should conduct a new asset allocation study to address the changes in cash flow forecasts. The lower contributions imply that the pension plan will need to rely more heavily on investment returns to reach its funding objectives. A higher allocation to return-seeking assets, such as public and private equities, is warranted. The company should sus-pend the current private equity liquidation plan until the new asset alloca-tion study has been completed. A liability-matching bond portfolio is still appropriate, although less than the current 80% of assets should be allocated to this portfolio.
SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN ASSET ALLOCATION
discuss the use of short-term shifts in asset allocation
Strategic asset allocation (SAA), or policy asset allocation, represents long-term 
investment policy targets for asset class weights, whereas tactical asset allocation 
(TAA) allows short-term deviations from SAA targets.19 TAA moves might be justified 
based on cyclical variations within a secular trend (e.g., stage of business or monetary 
cycle) or temporary price dislocations in capital markets. TAA has the objective of 
increasing return, or risk-adjusted return, by taking advantage of short-term economic 
and financial market conditions that appear more favorable to certain asset classes. In 
seeking to capture a short-term return opportunity, TAA decisions move the investor’s 
risk away from the targeted risk profile. TAA is predicated on a belief that invest -
ment returns, in the short run, are predictable. (This contrasts with the random walk 
assumption more strongly embedded in most SAA processes.) Using either short-term 
views or signals, the investor actively re-weights broad asset classes, sectors, or risk factor premiums. TAA is not concerned with individual security selection. In other 
words, generating alpha through TAA decisions is dependent on successful market or 
factor timing rather than security selection. TAA is an asset-only approach. Although 
tactical asset allocation shifts must still conform to the risk constraints outlined in the investment policy statement, they do not expressly consider liabilities (or goals in goals-based investing).
The SAA policy portfolio is the benchmark against which TAA decisions are mea -
sured. Tactical views are developed and bets are sized relative to the asset class targets 
of the SAA policy portfolio. The sizes of these bets are typically subject to certain risk 
constraints. The most common risk constraint is a pre-established allowable range 
19 SA A and TAA are distinct from GTAA (global tactical asset allocation), an opportunistic investment 
strategy that seeks to take advantage of pricing or valuation anomalies across multiple asset classes, typically 
equities, fixed income, and currencies.9

Learning Module 5  A sset Allocation with Real-World Constraints 342
around each asset class’s policy target. Other risk constraints may include either a 
predicted tracking error budget versus the SAA or a range of targeted risk (e.g., an allowable range of predicted volatility).
The success of TAA decisions can be evaluated in a number of ways. Three of the 
most common are
 ■a comparison of the Sharpe ratio realized under the TAA relative to the Sharpe ratio that would have been realized under the SAA;
 ■evaluating the information ratio or the t -statistic of the average excess 
return of the TAA portfolio relative to the SAA portfolio; and
 ■plotting the realized return and risk of the TAA portfolio versus the realized return and risk of portfolios along the SAA’s efficient frontier. This approach is particularly useful in assessing the risk-adjusted TAA return. The TAA portfolio may have produced a higher return or a higher Sharpe ratio than the SAA portfolio, but it could be less optimal than other portfolios along the investor’s efficient frontier of portfolio choices.
The composition of the portfolio’s excess return over the SAA portfolio return 
can also be examined more closely using attribution analysis, evaluating the specific overweights and underweights that led to the performance differential.
Tactical investment decisions may incur additional costs—higher trading costs 
and taxes (in the case of taxable investors). Tactical investment decisions can also increase the concentration of risk relative to the policy portfolio. For example, if the tactical decision is to overweight equities, not only is the portfolio risk increased but also the diversification of risk contributions is reduced. This is particularly an issue 
when the SAA policy portfolio relies on uncorrelated asset classes. These costs should 
be weighed against the predictability of short-term returns.
There are two broad approaches to TAA. The first is discretionary, which relies on 
a qualitative interpretation of political, economic, and financial market conditions. The second is systematic, which relies on quantitative signals to capture documented return anomalies that may be inconsistent with market efficiency.
Discretionary TAA
Discretionary TAA is predicated on the existence of manager skill in predicting and timing short-term market moves away from the expected outcome for each asset class that is embedded in the SAA policy portfolio. In practice, discretionary TAA is typically used in an attempt to mitigate or hedge risk in distressed markets while 
enhancing return in positive return markets (i.e., an asymmetric return distribution).
Short-term forecasts consider a large number of data points that provide relevant 
information about current and expected political, economic, and financial market conditions that may affect short-term asset class returns. Data points might include 
valuations, term and credit spreads, central bank policy, GDP growth, earnings expec -
tations, inflation expectations, and leading economic indicators. Price-to-earnings 
ratios, price-to-book ratios, and the dividend yield are commonly used valuation 
measures that can be compared to historical averages and across similar assets to inform short-to-intermediate-term tactical shifts. Term spreads provide information about the business cycle, inflation, and potential future interest rates. Credit spreads gauge default risk, borrowing conditions, and liquidity. Other data points are more directly related to current and expected GDP and earnings growth.

Short-Term Shifts in Asset Allocation 343
Short-term forecasts may also consider economic sentiment indicators. TAA 
often assumes a close relationship between the economy and capital market returns. 
Because consumer spending is a major driver of GDP in developed countries, consumer 
sentiment is a key consideration. Consumer confidence surveys provide insight as to 
the level of optimism regarding the economy and personal finances.
TAA also considers market sentiment—indicators of the optimism or pessimism 
of financial market participants. Data points considered in gauging market sentiment 
include margin borrowing, short interest, and a volatility index.
 ■Margin borrowing measures give an indication of the current level of bullishness, and the capacity for more or less margin borrowing has impli-cations for future bullishness. Higher prices tend to inspire confidence and spur more buying; similarly, more buying on margin tends to spur higher prices. The aggregate level of margin can be an indicator that bullish senti-ment is overdone, although the level of borrowing must be considered in the context of the rate of change in borrowing.
 ■Short interest measures give an indication of current bearish sentiment and also have implications for future bearishness. Although rising short interest indicates increasing negative sentiment, a high short interest ratio may be an indication of the extreme pessimism that often occurs at market lows.
 ■The volatility index, commonly known as the fear index, is a measure of market expectations of near-term volatility. VDAX-NEW in Germany, V2X in the United Kingdom, and VIX in the United States each measure the level of expected volatility of their respective indexes as implied by the bid/ask quotations of index options; it rises when put option buying increases and falls when call buying activity increases.
Different approaches to discretionary TAA may include different data points and 
relationships and also may prioritize and weight those data points differently depending 
on both the approach and the prevailing market environment. Despite the plethora of 
data inputs, the interpretation of this information is qualitative at its core.
Systematic TAA
Using signals, systematic TAA attempts to capture asset class level return anoma-lies that have been shown to have some predictability and persistence. Value and momentum, for example, are factors that have been determined to offer some level of predictability, both among securities within asset classes (for security selection) and at the asset class level (for asset class timing).
The value factor is the return of value stocks over the return of growth stocks. The 
momentum factor is the return of stocks with higher prior returns over the return of stocks with lower prior returns. Value and momentum (and size) factors have been determined to have some explanatory power regarding the relative returns of equity securities within the equity asset class. Value and momentum phenomena are also present at the asset class level and can be used in making tactical asset allocation decisions across asset classes.

Valuation ratios have been shown to have some explanatory power in predicting 
variation in future equity returns. Predictive measures for equities include dividend 
yield, cash flow yield, and Shiller’s earnings yield (the inverse of Shiller’s P/E20). 
Sometimes these yield measures are defined as the excess of the yield over the local 
risk-free rate or inflation.21
Other asset classes have their own value signals, such as yield and carry in curren -
cies, commodities, and/or fixed income. Carry in currencies uses short-term interest rate differentials to determine which currencies (or currency-denominated assets) to overweight (or own) and which to underweight (or sell short). Carry in commodities compares positive (backwardation) and negative (contango) roll yields to determine which commodities to own or short. And for bonds, yields-to-maturity and term 
premiums (yields in excess of the local risk-free rate) signal the relative attractiveness 
of different fixed-income markets.
Asset classes can trend positively or negatively for some time before changing 
course. Trend following is an investment or trading strategy based on the expectation 
that asset class (or asset) returns will continue in the same upward or downward 
trend that they have most recently exhibited.22 A basic trend signal is the most recent 
12-month return: The expectation is that the direction of the most recent 12-month returns can be expected to persist for the next 12 months. Shorter time frames and 
different weighting schemes can also be used. For example, another trend signal is the 
moving-average crossover, where the moving average price of a shorter time frame is compared with the moving average price of a longer time frame. This signals an 
upward (downward) trend when the moving average of the shorter time frame is 
above (below) the moving average of the longer time frame. Trend signals are widely used in systematic TAA. Asset classes may be ranked or categorized into positive or 
negative buckets based on their most recent prior 12-month performance and over- or 
underweighted accordingly. More-complex signals for both momentum/trend signals 
(such as those that use different lookback periods or momentum signals correlated with earnings momentum) and value/carry are also used.

Solution:
The TAA decision must be taken in the context of the SAA policy con-
straints. Thus, although the signals for high-yield bonds and emerging market equities are negative, the minimum permissible weight in each is 5%. Similarly, although the signals for investment-grade bonds and developed markets equities are positive, the maximum permissible weight in each is 45%. Asset classes can be over- or underweighted to the full extent of the policy limits. Based on the trend signals and the policy constraints, the rec-ommended tactical asset allocation is as follows:
 
• Investment-grade bonds 45% (overweight by 5%)
• High-yield bonds 5% (underweight by 5%)
• Developed markets equity 45% (overweight by 5%)
• Emerging markets equity 5% (underweight by 5%)
 
2. One ye ar later, the Investment Committee for Alpha Beverage Corpora-
tion is conducting its year-end review of pension plan performance. Staff has prepared the following exhibits regarding the tactical asset allocation decisions taken during the past year. Assume that all investments are imple-mented using passively managed index funds. Evaluate the effectiveness of the TAA decisions.
Solution:
The decision to overweight investment grade bonds and underweight emerging markets equity and high-yield bonds was a profitable one. The chosen asset allocation added approximately 120 basis points to portfolio return over the year. Although portfolio risk was elevated relative to the policy portfolio (standard deviation of 6.2% versus 5.8% for the policy port-folio), the portfolio positioning improved the fund’s Sharpe ratio relative to allocations they might have selected along the efficient frontier.
A SILVER LINING TO THE 2008–2009 GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS
Prior to 2008, corporate pension plans had begun to shift the fixed-income 
component of their policy portfolios from an intermediate maturity bond index 
to a long bond index. Despite the relatively low interest rates at the time, this move was made to better align the plans’ assets with the long duration liabil-ity payment stream. The fixed-income portfolios were typically benchmarked 
against a long government and credit index that included both government and 
corporate bonds. Swaps or STRIPS* were sometimes used to extend duration.
During the global financial crisis that began in 2008, these heavier and lon-
ger-duration fixed-income positions performed well relative to equities (the long 
government and credit index was up 8%, whereas the S&P 500 Index was down 
37% in 2008), providing plan sponsors with a level of investment protection that

had not been anticipated. Additionally, with its exposure to higher-returning 
government bonds that benefited from investors’ flight to safety, this fixed-income 
portfolio often outperformed the liabilities. (Recall from the earlier discussion on 
pension regulation that pension liabilities are typically measured using corporate 
bond yields. Thus, liabilities rose in the face of declining corporate bond yields 
while the liability-hedging asset rose even further given its overall higher credit quality.) This was an unintended asset/liability mismatch that had very positive results. Subsequent to this rally in bonds, some plan sponsors made a tactical 
asset allocation decision—to move out of swaps and government bonds and into 
physical corporate bonds (non-derivative fixed-income exposure)—locking in the gains and better hedging the liability.
* Treasury STRIPS are fixed-income securities with no interest payments that 
are sold at a discount to face value and mature at par. STRIPS is an acronym for Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities.
DEALING WITH BEHAVIORAL BIASES IN ASSET 
ALLOCATION
identify behavioral biases that arise in asset allocation and 
recommend methods to overcome them
Although global capital markets are competitive pricing engines, human behavior can be less rational than most economic models assume. Behavioral finance—the hybrid study of financial economics and psychology—has documented a number of behavioral biases that commonly arise in investing. The CFA Program reading “The Behavioral Biases of Individuals” discusses 16 common behavioral biases. The biases most relevant in asset allocation include loss aversion, the illusion of control, men-tal accounting, representativeness bias, framing, and availability bias. An effective investment program will address these decision-making risks through a formal asset allocation process with its own objective framework, governance, and controls. An 
important first step toward mitigating the negative effects of behavioral biases is simply 
acknowledging that they exist; just being aware of them can reduce their influence on decision making. It is also possible to incorporate certain behavioral biases into the investment decision-making process to produce better outcomes. This is most commonly practiced in goals-based investing. We will discuss strategies that help deal with these common biases.
Loss Aversion
Loss-aversion bias is an emotional bias in which people tend to strongly prefer avoiding 
losses as opposed to achieving gains. A number of studies on loss aversion suggest that, psychologically, losses are significantly more powerful than gains. The utility derived from a gain is much lower than the utility given up with an equivalent loss. This behavior is related to the marginal utility of wealth, where each additional dollar of wealth is valued incrementally less with increasing levels of wealth.
A diversified multi-asset class portfolio is generally thought to offer an approxi-
mately symmetrical distribution of returns around a positive expected mean return. 
Financial market theory suggests that a rational investor would think about risk as the 
dispersion or uncertainty (variance) around the mean (expected) outcome. However, 10

Learning Module 5  A sset Allocation with Real-World Constraints 348
loss aversion suggests the investor assigns a greater weight to the negative outcomes 
than would be implied by the actual shape of the distribution. Looking at this another 
way, risk is not measured relative to the expected mean return but rather on an absolute 
basis, relative to a 0% return. The loss-aversion bias may interfere with an investor’s 
ability to maintain his chosen asset allocation through periods of negative returns.
In goals-based investing, loss-aversion bias can be mitigated by framing risk in 
terms of shortfall probability or by funding high-priority goals with low-risk assets.
Shortfall probability is the probability that a portfolio will not achieve the 
return required to meet a stated goal. Where there are well-defined, discrete goals, 
sub-portfolios can be established for each goal and the asset allocation for that 
sub-portfolio would use shortfall probability as the definition of risk.
Similarly, by segregating assets into sub-portfolios aligned to goals designated by 
the client as high-priority and investing those assets in risk-free or low risk assets of similar duration, the adviser mitigates the loss-aversion bias associated with this particular goal—freeing up other assets to take on a more appropriate level of risk. Riskier assets can then be used to fund lower-priority and aspirational goals.
In institutional investing, loss aversion can be seen in the herding behavior among 
plan sponsors. Adopting an asset allocation not too different from the allocation of one’s peers minimizes reputation risk.
Illusion of Control
The illusion of control is a cognitive bias—the tendency to overestimate one’s ability 
to control events. It can be exacerbated by overconfidence, an emotional bias. If 
investors believe they have more or better information than what is reflected in the market, they have (excessive) confidence in their ability to generate better outcomes. 
They may perceive information  in what are random price movements, which may lead 
to more frequent trading, greater concentration of portfolio positions, or a greater willingness to employ tactical shifts in their asset allocation. The following investor behaviors might be attributed to this illusion of control:
 ■Alpha-seeking behaviors, such as attempted market timing in the form of extreme tactical asset allocation shifts or all in/all out market calls—the investor who correctly anticipated a market reversal now believes he has superior insight on valuation levels.
 ■Alpha-seeking behaviors based on a belief of superior resources—the insti-tutional investor who believes her internal resources give her an edge over other investors in active security selection and/or the selection of active investment managers.
 ■Excessive trading, use of leverage, or short selling—the long/short equity investor who moves from a normal exposure range of 65% long/20% short to 100% long/50% short.
 ■Reducing, eliminating, or even shorting asset classes that are a significant part of the global market portfolio based on non-consensus return and risk forecasts—the chair of a foundation’s investment committee who calls for shortening the duration of the bond portfolio from six years to six months based on insights drawn from his position in the banking industry.
 ■Retaining a large, concentrated legacy asset that contributes diversifiable risk—the employee who fails to diversify her holding of company stock.
Hindsight bias—the tendency to perceive past investment outcomes as having 
been predictable—exacerbates the illusion of control.

Dealing with Behavioral Biases in Asset Allocation 349
In the asset allocation process, an investor who believes he or she has better 
information than others may use estimates of return and risk that produce asset 
allocation choices that are materially different from the market portfolio. This can 
result in undiversified portfolios with outsized exposures to just one or two minor 
asset classes, called extreme corner portfolios. Using such biased risk and return 
estimates results in a biased asset allocation decision—precisely what an objective asset allocation process seeks to avoid.
The illusion of control can be mitigated by using the global market portfolio as 
the starting point in developing the asset allocation. Building on the basic principles 
of CAPM, Markowitz’s mean–variance theory, and efficient market theory, the global 
market portfolio offers a theoretically sound benchmark for asset allocation. Deviations 
from this baseline portfolio must be thoughtfully considered and rigorously vetted, 
ensuring the asset allocation process remains objective. A formal asset allocation 
process that employs long-term return and risk forecasts, optimization constraints anchored around asset class weights in the global market portfolio, and strict policy ranges will significantly mitigate the illusion of control bias in asset allocation.
Mental Accounting
Mental accounting is an information-processing bias in which people treat one sum of 
money differently from another sum based solely on the mental account the money is 
assigned to. Investors may separate assets or liabilities into buckets based on subjective 
criteria. For example, an investor may consider his retirement investment portfolio independent of the portfolio that funds his child’s education, even if the combined asset allocation of the two portfolios is sub-optimal. Or an employee with significant exposure to her employer’s stock through vested stock options may fail to consider this exposure alongside other assets when establishing a strategic asset allocation.
Goals-based investing incorporates mental accounting directly into the asset allo -
cation solution. Each goal is aligned with a discrete sub-portfolio, and the investor can 
specify the acceptable level of risk for each goal. Provided each of the sub-portfolios lies 
along the same efficient frontier, the sum of the sub-portfolios will also be efficient.23
Concentrated stock positions also give rise to another common mental accounting 
issue that affects asset allocation. For example, the primary source of an entrepreneur’s 
wealth may be a concentrated equity position in the publicly traded company he 
founded. The entrepreneur may prefer to retain a relatively large exposure to this one security within his broader investment portfolio despite the inherent risk. Although there may be rational reasons for this preference—including ownership control, an 
information advantage, and tax considerations—the desire to retain this riskier expo -
sure is more often the result of a psychological loyalty to the asset that generated his 
wealth. This mental accounting bias is further reinforced by the endowment effect—the 
tendency to ascribe more value to an asset already owned rather than another asset one might purchase to replace it.
The concentrated stock/mental accounting bias can be accommodated in goals-based 
asset allocation by assigning the concentrated stock position to an aspirational goal—
one that the client would like  to achieve but to which he or she is willing to assign a 
lower probability of success. Whereas lifetime consumption tends to be a high-priority 
goal requiring a well-diversified portfolio to fund it with confidence, an aspirational 
23 Thi s condition holds when the asset allocation process is unconstrained. With a long-only constraint, some efficiency is lost but the effect is much less significant than the loss of efficiency from inaccurately specifying risk aversion (which goals-based approaches to asset allocation attempt to mitigate). See Das, Markowitz, Scheid, and Statman (2010) and Das et al. (2011).

goal such as a charitable gift may be an important but much less highly valued goal. 
It can reasonably be funded with the concentrated stock position. (This could have the additional benefit of avoiding capital gains tax altogether!)
Representativeness Bias
Representativeness, or recency, bias is the tendency to overweight the importance of the most recent observations and information relative to a longer-dated or more 
comprehensive set of long-term observations and information. Tactical shifts in 
asset allocation, those undertaken in response to recent returns or news—perhaps shifting the asset allocation toward the highest or lowest allowable ends of the policy ranges—are particularly susceptible to recency bias. Return chasing is a common manifestation of recency bias, and it results in overweighting asset classes with good recent performance.
It is believed that asset prices largely follow a random walk; past prices cannot 
be used to predict future returns. If this is true, then shifting the asset allocation in response to recent returns, or allowing recent returns to unduly influence the asset class assumptions used in the asset allocation process, will likely lead to sub-optimal results. If, however, asset class returns exhibit trending behavior, the recent past may  
contain information relevant to tactical shifts in asset allocation. And if asset class returns are mean-reverting, comparing current valuations to historical norms may signal the potential for a reversal or for above-average future returns.
Recency bias is not uniformly negative. Random walk, trending, and mean-reversion 
may be simultaneously relevant to the investment decision-making process, although 
their effect on asset prices will unfold over different time horizons. The strongest defenses against recency bias are an objective asset allocation process and a strong 
governance framework. It is important that the investor objectively evaluate the 
motivation underlying the response to recent market events. A formal asset alloca-tion policy with pre-specified allowable ranges will constrain recency bias. A strong governance framework with the appropriate level of expertise and well-documented investment beliefs increases the likelihood that shifts in asset allocation are made objectively and in accordance with those beliefs.
Framing Bias
Framing bias is an information-processing bias in which a person may answer a ques -
tion differently based solely on the way in which it is asked. One example of framing 
bias is common in committee-oriented decision-making processes. In instances where 
one individual frequently speaks first and speaks with great authority, the views of other committee members may be suppressed or biased toward this first position put on the table.
A more nuanced form of framing bias can be found in asset allocation. The inves -
tor’s choice of an asset allocation may be influenced merely by the manner in which the risk-to-return trade-off is presented.
Risk can mean different things to different investors: volatility, tail risk, the per -
manent loss of capital, or a failure to meet financial goals. These definitions are all closely related, but the relative importance of each of these aspects can influence the investor’s asset allocation choice. Further, the investor’s perception of each of these risks can be influenced by the manner in which they are presented—gain and loss potential framed in money terms versus percentages, for example.
Investors are often asked to evaluate portfolio choices using expected return, 
with standard deviation as the sole measure of risk. Standard deviation measures the dispersion or volatility around the mean (expected) return. Other measures of risk may also be used. Value at risk (VaR) is a loss threshold: “If I choose this asset mix, I

Dealing with Behavioral Biases in Asset Allocation 351
can be pretty sure that my losses will not exceed X, most of the time. ” More formally, 
VaR is the minimum loss that would be expected a certain percentage of the time over 
a certain period of time given the assumed market conditions. Conditional value at 
risk (CVaR) is the probability-weighted average of losses when the VaR threshold is breached. VaR and CVaR both measure downside or tail risk.
Exhibit 16 shows the expected return and risk for five portfolios that span an 
efficient frontier from P1 (lowest risk) to P100 (highest risk). A normal distribution of returns is assumed; therefore, the portfolio’s VaR and CVaR are a direct function of the portfolio’s expected return and standard deviation. In this case, standard devi-ation, VaR, and CVaR measure precisely the same risk but frame that risk differently. Standard deviation presents that risk as volatility, while VaR and CVaR present it as risk of loss. When dealing with a normal distribution, as this example presumes, the 5% VaR threshold is simply the point on the distribution 1.65 standard deviations below the expected mean return.
Exhibit 16: There’s More Than One Way to Frame Risk
  P1 P25 P50 P75 P100
Return 3.2% 4.9% 6.0% 7.0% 8.0%
Std. Dev. 3.9% 7.8% 11.9% 15.9% 20.0%
VaR (5%) −3.2% −8.0% −13.6% −19.3% −25.0%
CVaR (5%) −4.8% −11.2% −18.5% −25.8% −33.2%
When viewing return and volatility alone, many investors may gravitate to P50 with its 6.0% expected return and 11.9% standard deviation. P50 represents the median risk portfolio that appeals to many investors in practice because it balances high-risk 
and low-risk choices with related diversification benefits. However, loss-aversion bias 
suggests that some investors who gravitate to the median choice might actually find 
the −18.5% CVaR of P50 indicative of a level of risk they find very uncomfortable. The 
CVaR frame intuitively communicates a different perspective of exactly the same risk 
that is already fully explained by standard deviation—namely, the downside or tail-risk 
aspects of the standard deviation and mean. With this example, you can see that how risk is framed and presented can affect the asset allocation decision.
The framing effect can be mitigated by presenting the possible asset allocation 
choices with multiple perspectives on the risk/reward trade-off. The most commonly used risk measure—standard deviation—can be supplemented with additional mea-
sures, such as shortfall probability (the probability of failing to meet a specific 
liability or goal)24 and tail-risk measures (e.g., VaR and CVaR). Historical stress tests 
and Monte Carlo simulations can also be used to capture and communicate risk in a tangible way. These multiple perspectives of the risk and reward trade-offs among a set of asset allocation choices compel the investor to consider more carefully what outcomes are acceptable or unacceptable.
24 Shor tfall risk and shortfall probability are often used to refer to the same concept. This author prefers shortfall probability because the measure refers to the probability of shortfall, not the magnitude of the potential shortfall. For example, you may have a low probability of shortfall but the size of the shortfall could be significant. In this case, it could be misleading to say the shortfall risk is low.

Availability Bias
Availability bias is an information-processing bias in which people take a mental 
shortcut when estimating the probability of an outcome based on how easily the 
outcome comes to mind. Easily recalled outcomes are often perceived as being more 
likely than those that are harder to recall or understand. For example, more recent events or events in which the investor has personally been affected are likely to be assigned a higher probability of occurring again, regardless of the objective odds of the event actually occurring. Availability bias in this context is termed the recency effect and is a subset of recency, or representativeness, bias.
As an example, many private equity investors experienced a liquidity squeeze 
during the financial crisis that began in 2008. Their equity portfolios had suffered large losses, and their private equity investments were illiquid. Worse yet, they were contractually committed to additional capital contributions to those private equity funds. At the same time, their financial obligations continued at the same or an even higher pace. Investors who personally experienced this confluence of negative events are likely to express a strong preference for liquid investments, assigning a higher probability to such an event occurring again than would an investor who had cash available to acquire the private equity interests that were sold at distressed prices.
Familiarity bias stems from availability bias: People tend to favor the familiar over 
the new or different because of the ease of recalling the familiar. In asset allocation, familiarity bias most commonly results in a home bias—a preference for securities 
listed on the exchanges of one’s home country. However, concentrating portfolio 
exposure in home country securities, particularly if the home country capital markets 
are small, results in a less diversified, less efficient portfolio. Familiarity bias can be mitigated by using the global market portfolio as the starting point in developing the asset allocation, where deviations from this baseline portfolio must be thoughtfully considered and rigorously vetted.
Familiarity bias may also cause investors to fall into the trap of comparing their 
investment decisions (and performance) to others’ , without regard for the appropri-ateness of those decisions for their own specific facts and circumstances. By avoid-ing comparison of investment returns or asset allocation decisions with others, an organization is more capable of identifying the asset allocation that is best tailored to their needs.
Investment decision making is subject to a wide range of potential behavioral 
biases. This is true in both private wealth and  institutional investing. Employing a 
formal asset allocation process using the global market portfolio as the starting point for asset allocation modeling is a key component of ensuring the asset allocation decision is as objective as possible.
A strong governance structure, such as that discussed in the overview reading on 
asset allocation, is a necessary first step to mitigating the effect that these behavioral biases may have on the long-term success of the investment program. Bringing a diverse set of views to the deliberation process brings more tools to the table to solve 
any problem and leads to better and more informed decision making. A clearly stated 
mission—a common goal—and a commitment from committee members and other stakeholders to that mission are critically important in constraining the influence of these biases on investment decisions.

EXAMPLE 8
Mitigating Behavioral Biases in Asset Allocation
Ivy Lee, the retired founder of a publicly traded company, has two primary 
goals for her investment assets. The first goal is to fund lifetime consumption 
expenditures of US$1 million per year for herself and her husband; this is a goal 
the Lees want to achieve with a high degree of certainty. The second goal is to 
provide an end-of-life gift to Auldberg University. Ivy has a diversified portfolio 
of stocks and bonds totaling US$5 million and a sizable position in the stock of the company she founded. The following table summarizes the facts.
 
Investor Profile
 
 
Annual consumption needs US$1,000,000
Remaining years of life expectancy 40
Diversified stock holdings US$3,000,000
Diversified bond holdings US$2,000,000
Concentrated stock holdings US$15,000,000
Total portfolio US$20,000,000
 
Assume that a 60% equity/40% fixed-income portfolio represents the level 
of risk Ivy is willing to assume with respect to her consumption goal. This 60/40 
portfolio offers an expected return of 6.0%. (For simplicity, this illustration 
ignores inflation and taxes.)
The present value of the expected consumption expenditures is US$15,949,075. 
This is the amount needed on hand today, which, if invested in a portfolio of 60% 
equities and 40% fixed income, would fully fund 40 annual cash distributions of US$1,000,000 each.
25
The concentrated stock has a highly uncertain expected return and comes 
with significant idiosyncratic (stock-specific) risk. A preliminary mean–variance 
optimization using three “asset classes”—stocks, bonds, and the concentrated stock—results in a zero allocation to the concentrated stock position. But Ivy prefers to retain as much concentrated stock as possible because it represents her legacy and she has a strong psychological loyalty to it.

1. D escribe the behavioral biases most relevant to developing an asset alloca-
tion recommendation for Ivy.
Solution:
Two behavioral biases that the adviser must be aware of in developing an 
asset allocation recommendation for Ivy are illusion of control and men-tal accounting. Because Ivy was the founder of the company whose stock comprises 75% of her investment portfolio, she may believe she has more or better information about the return prospects for this portion of the port-folio. The belief that she has superior information may lead to a risk assess-ment that is not reflective of the true risk in the holding. Using a goals-based approach to asset allocation may help Ivy more fully understand the risks inherent in the concentrated stock position. The riskier, concentrated stock position can be assigned to a lower-priority goal, such as the gift to Auld-berg University.

above.

Concentrated stock US$15,000,000 US$4,000,000
Total portfolio US$20,000,000 US$20,000,000
 
It is recommended that Ivy fully fund her high-priority lifestyle consump-tion needs (US$15,949,075) with US$16 million in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. To achieve this, US$11 million of the concentrated stock position should be sold and the proceeds added to the diversified portfolio that supports lifestyle consumption needs. The remaining US$4 million of concentrated stock can be retained to fund the aspirational goal of an end-of-life gift to Auldberg University. In this example, the adviser has employed the mental accounting bias to achieve a suitable outcome: By illustrating the dollar value needed to fund the high-priority lifetime consumption needs goal, the adviser was able to clarify for Ivy the risks in retaining the concen-trated stock position. The adviser might also simulate portfolio returns and the associated probability of achieving Ivy’s goals using a range of scenarios for the performance of the concentrated stock position. Framing the effect this one holding may have on the likelihood of achieving her goals may help Ivy agree to reduce the position size. Consideration of certain behavioral biases like mental accounting can improve investor outcomes when they are incorporated in an objective decision-making framework.

Dealing with Behavioral Biases in Asset Allocation 355
SUMMARY
 ■The primary constraints on an asset allocation decision are asset size, 
liquidity, time horizon, and other external considerations, such as taxes and regulation.
 ■The size of an asset owner’s portfolio may limit the asset classes accessible to the asset owner. An asset owner’s portfolio may be too small—or too large—to capture the returns of certain asset classes or strategies efficiently.
 ■Complex asset classes and investment vehicles require sufficient governance capacity.
 ■Large-scale asset owners may achieve operating efficiencies, but they may find it difficult to deploy capital effectively in certain active investment strat -
egies given liquidity conditions and trading costs.
 ■Smaller portfolios may also be constrained by size. They may be too small to adequately diversify across the range of asset classes and investment manag-ers, or they may have staffing constraints that prevent them from monitor -
ing a complex investment program.
 ■Investors with smaller portfolios may be constrained in their ability to access private equity, private real estate, hedge funds, and infrastructure investments because of the high required minimum investments and regu-latory restrictions associated with those asset classes. Wealthy families may pool assets to meet the required minimums.
 ■The liquidity needs of the asset owner and the liquidity characteristics of the asset classes each influence the available opportunity set.
 ■Liquidity needs must also take into consideration the financial strength of the investor and resources beyond those held in the investment portfolio.
 ■When assessing the appropriateness of any given asset class for a given investor, it is important to evaluate potential liquidity needs in the context of an extreme market stress event.
 ■An investor’s time horizon must be considered in any asset allocation exer -
cise. Changes in human capital and the changing character of liabilities are two important time-related constraints of asset allocation.
 ■External considerations—such as regulations, tax rules, funding, and financ -
ing needs—are also likely to influence the asset allocation decision.
 ■Taxes alter the distribution of returns by both reducing the expected mean return and muting the dispersion of returns. Asset values and asset risk and return inputs to asset allocation should be modified to reflect the tax status of the investor. Correlation assumptions do not need to be adjusted, but taxes do affect the return and the standard deviation assumptions for each asset class.
 ■Periodic portfolio rebalancing to return the portfolio to its target strategic asset allocation is an integral part of sound portfolio management. Taxable investors must consider the tax implications of rebalancing.
 ■Rebalancing thresholds may be wider for taxable portfolios because it takes larger asset class movements to materially alter the risk profile of the taxable portfolio.
 ■Strategic asset location is the placement of less tax-efficient assets in accounts with more-favorable tax treatment.

 ■An asset owner’s strategic asset allocation should be re-examined periodi-
cally, even in the absence of a change in the asset owner’s circumstances.
 ■A special review of the asset allocation policy may be triggered by a change in goals, constraints, or beliefs.
 ■In some situations, a change to an asset allocation strategy may be imple-mented without a formal asset allocation study. Anticipating key mile-stones that would alter the asset owner’s risk appetite, and implementing pre-established changes to the asset allocation in response, is often referred to as a “glide path. ”
 ■Tactical asset allocation (TAA) allows short-term deviations from the strate-gic asset allocation (SAA) targets and are expected to increase risk-adjusted return. Using either short-term views or signals, the investor actively re-weights broad asset classes, sectors, or risk-factor premiums. The sizes of these deviations from the SAA are often constrained by the Investment Policy Statement.
 ■The success of TAA decisions is measured against the performance of the SAA policy portfolio by comparing Sharpe ratios, evaluating the informa-tion ratio or the t -statistic of the average excess return of the TAA portfo-
lio relative to the SAA portfolio, or plotting outcomes versus the efficient frontier.
 ■TAA incurs trading and tax costs. Tactical trades can also increase the con-centration of risk.
 ■Discretionary TAA relies on a qualitative interpretation of political, eco-nomic, and financial market conditions and is predicated on a belief of persistent manager skill in predicting and timing short-term market moves.
 ■Systematic TAA relies on quantitative signals to capture documented return anomalies that may be inconsistent with market efficiency.
 ■The behavioral biases most relevant in asset allocation include loss aver -
sion, the illusion of control, mental accounting, recency bias, framing, and availability bias.
 ■An effective investment program will address behavioral biases through a formal asset allocation process with its own objective framework, gover -
nance, and controls.
 ■In goals-based investing, loss-aversion bias can be mitigated by framing risk in terms of shortfall probability or by funding high-priority goals with low-risk assets.
 ■The cognitive bias, illusion of control, and hindsight bias can all be miti-gated by using a formal asset allocation process that uses long-term return and risk forecasts, optimization constraints anchored around asset class weights in the global market portfolio, and strict policy ranges.
 ■Goals-based investing incorporates the mental accounting bias directly into the asset allocation solution by aligning each goal with a discrete sub-portfolio.
 ■A formal asset allocation policy with pre-specified allowable ranges may constrain recency bias.
 ■The framing bias effect can be mitigated by presenting the possible asset allocation choices with multiple perspectives on the risk/reward trade-off.
 ■Familiarity bias, a form of availability bias, most commonly results in an overweight in home country securities and may also cause investors to inap-propriately compare their investment decisions (and performance) to other

organizations. Familiarity bias can be mitigated by using the global market 
portfolio as the starting point in developing the asset allocation and by care-fully evaluating any potential deviations from this baseline portfolio.
 ■A strong governance framework with the appropriate level of expertise and well-documented investment beliefs increases the likelihood that shifts in asset allocation are made objectively and in accordance with those beliefs. This will help to mitigate the effect that behavioral biases may have on the long-term success of the investment program.

Practice Problems 359
PRACTICE PROBLEMS
The following information relates to questions 
1-7
Elsbeth Quinn and Dean McCall are partners at Camel Asset Management (CAM). Quinn advises high-net-worth individuals, and McCall specializes in retirement plans for institutions.
Quinn meets with Neal and Karina Martin, both age 44. The Martins plan to re-
tire at age 62. Twenty percent of the Martins’ $600,000 in financial assets is held in cash and earmarked for funding their daughter Lara’s university studies, which begin in one year. Lara’s education and their own retirement are the Martins’ highest-priority goals. Last week, the Martins learned that Lara was awarded a four-year full scholarship for university. Quinn reviews how the scholarship might affect the Martins’ asset allocation strategy.
The Martins have assets in both taxable and tax-deferred accounts. For baseline 
retirement needs, Quinn recommends that the Martins maintain their current overall 60% equity/40% bonds (± 8% rebalancing range) strategic asset allocation. Quinn calculates that given current financial assets and expected future earnings, the Martins could reduce future retirement savings by 15% and still comfortably retire at 62. The Martins wish to allocate that 15% to a sub-portfolio with the goal of making a charitable gift to their alma mater from their estate. Although the gift is a low-priority goal, the Martins want the sub-portfolio to earn the highest return possible. Quinn promises to recommend an asset allocation strategy for the Martins’ aspirational goal.
Next, Quinn discusses taxation of investments with the Martins. Their interest 
income is taxed at 35%, and capital gains and dividends are taxed at 20%. The Martins want to minimize taxes. Based on personal research, Neal makes the following two statements:
Statement 1
 The af
ter-tax return volatility of assets held in taxable accounts 
will be less than the pre-tax return volatility.
Statement 2
 A
ssets that receive more favorable tax treatment should be held 
in tax-deferred accounts.
The equity portion of the Martins’ portfolios produced an annualized return of 20% for the past three years. As a result, the Martins’ equity allocation in both their taxable and tax-deferred portfolios has increased to 71%, with bonds falling to 29%. The Martins want to keep the strategic asset allocation risk levels the same in both types of retirement portfolios. Quinn discusses rebalancing; howev-er, Neal is somewhat reluctant to take money out of stocks, expressing confidence that strong investment returns will continue.
Quinn’s CAM associate, McCall, meets with Bruno Snead, the director of the 
Katt Company Pension Fund (KCPF). The strategic asset allocation for the fund is 65% stocks/35% bonds. Because of favorable returns during the past eight recession-free years, the KCPF is now overfunded. However, there are early signs of the economy weakening. Since Katt Company is in a cyclical industry, the Pen-sion Committee is concerned about future market and economic risk and fears that the high-priority goal of maintaining a fully funded status may be adversely affected. McCall suggests to Snead that the KCPF might benefit from an updated IPS. Following a thorough review, McCall recommends a new IPS and strategic

The proposed IPS revisions include a plan for short-term deviations from stra-
tegic asset allocation targets. The goal is to benefit from equity market trends by automatically increasing (decreasing) the allocation to equities by 5% whenever the S&P 500 Index 50-day moving average crosses above (below) the 200-day moving average.

Rebecca Mayer is an asset management consultant for institutions and high-net-worth individuals. Mayer meets with Sebastian Capara, the newly ap-pointed Investment Committee chairman for the Kinkardeen University Endow-ment (KUE), a very large tax-exempt fund.
Capara and Mayer review KUE’s current and strategic asset allocations, which 
are presented in Exhibit 1. Capara informs Mayer that over the last few years, Kinkardeen University has financed its operations primarily from tuition, with minimal need of financial support from KUE. Enrollment at the University has been rising in recent years, and the Board of Trustees expects enrollment growth to continue for the next five years. Consequently, the board expects very modest endowment support to be needed during that time. These expectations led the Investment Committee to approve a decrease in the endowment’s annual spend-ing rate starting in the next fiscal year.

As an additional source of alpha, Mayer proposes tactically adjusting KUE’s 
asset-class weights to profit from short-term return opportunities. To confirm his understanding of tactical asset allocation (TAA), Capara tells Mayer the following:

relative to SAA.

Statement 3  T AA allows a manager to deviate from the IPS asset-class 
upper and lower limits if the shift is expected to produce higher 
expected risk-adjusted returns.
Capara asks Mayer to recommend a TAA strategy based on excess return fore-
casts for the asset classes in KUE’s portfolio, as shown in Exhibit 2.

Asset ClassExpected Excess 
Return
Developed markets equity 2%
Emerging markets equity 5%

Infrastructure –1%
Following her consultation with Capara, Mayer meets with Roger Koval, a mem-ber of a wealthy family. Although Koval’s baseline needs are secured by a family trust, Koval has a personal portfolio to fund his lifestyle goals.
In Koval’s country, interest income is taxed at progressively higher income tax 
rates. Dividend income and long-term capital gains are taxed at lower tax rates relative to interest and earned income. In taxable accounts, realized capital losses can be used to offset current or future realized capital gains. Koval is in a high tax bracket, and his taxable account currently holds, in equal weights, high-yield bonds, investment-grade bonds, and domestic equities focused on long-term capital gains.
Koval asks Mayer about adding new asset classes to the taxable portfolio. Mayer 
suggests emerging markets equity given its positive short-term excess return forecast. However, Koval tells Mayer he is not interested in adding emerging mar-kets equity to the account because he is convinced it is too risky. Koval justifies this belief by referring to significant losses the family trust suffered during the recent economic crisis.
Mayer also suggests using two mean–variance portfolio optimization scenarios 
for the taxable account to evaluate potential asset allocations. Mayer recom-mends running two optimizations: one on a pre-tax basis and another on an after-tax basis.

Emma Young, a 47-year-old single mother of two daughters, ages 7 and 10, recently sold a business for $5.5 million net of taxes and put the proceeds into a money market account. Her other assets include a tax-deferred retirement account worth $3.0 million, a $500,000 after-tax account designated for her daughters’ education, a $400,000 after-tax account for unexpected needs, and her home, which she owns outright.
Her living expenses are fully covered by her job. Young wants to retire in 15 years

Mark DuBord, a financial adviser, works with two university foundations, the Titan State Foundation (Titan) and the Fordhart University Foundation (Ford-hart). He meets with each university foundation investment committee annually to review fund objectives and constraints.
Titan’s portfolio has a market value of $10 million. After his annual meeting with 
its investment committee, DuBord notes the following points:
 ■Titan must spend 3% of its beginning-of-the-year asset value annually to 
meet legal obligations.
 ■The investment committee seeks exposure to private equity investments and requests DuBord’s review of the Sun-Fin Private Equity Fund as a potential new investment.
 ■A recent declining trend in enrollment is expected to continue. This is a concern because it has led to a loss of operating revenue from tuition.
 ■Regulatory sanctions and penalties are likely to result in lower donations over the next five years.

SOLUTIONS
1. A i s correct. The changing character of liabilities through time affects the asset 
allocation to fund those liabilities. The Martins’ investment horizon for some of 
their assets has changed. The amount of liquidity needed for Lara’s near-term education has been greatly reduced owing to the receipt of the scholarship. The Martins will likely still have to pay for some university-related expenses; however, a large part of the $120,000 in cash that is earmarked for Lara’s expenses can now be allocated to the Martins’ long-term goal of early retirement. Retirement is 18 years away, much longer than the one- to five-year horizon for university expens-es. Therefore, the Martins’ allocation to cash would likely decrease.
2.
 C i
s correct. The Martins’ sub-portfolio is aspirational and a low priority. Inves-
tors are usually willing to take more risk on lower-priority, aspirational portfolios. The charitable gift will be made from their estate, which indicates a long time horizon. In addition, the Martins want the highest return possible. Therefore, the highest allocation to equities is most appropriate.
3.
 A i
s correct. Taxes alter the distribution of returns by both reducing the expect-
ed mean return and muting the dispersion of returns. The portion of an owner’s taxable assets that are eligible for lower tax rates and deferred capital gains tax treatment should first be allocated to the investor’s taxable accounts.
4.
 A i
s correct. The Martins wish to maintain the same risk level for both retire-
ment accounts based on their strategic asset allocation. However, more frequent rebalancing exposes the taxable asset owner to realized taxes that could have otherwise been deferred or even avoided. Rebalancing is discretionary, and the Martins’ also wish to minimize taxes. Because after-tax return volatility is lower than pre-tax return volatility, it takes larger asset-class movements to materially alter the risk profile of a taxable portfolio. This suggests that rebalancing ranges for a taxable portfolio can be wider than those of a tax-exempt/tax-deferred port-folio with a similar risk profile; thus, rebalancing occurs less frequently.
5.
 C i
s correct. Representativeness, or recency, bias is the tendency to overweight 
the importance of the most recent observations and information relative to a longer-dated or more comprehensive set of long-term observations and informa-tion. Return chasing is a common result of this bias, and it results in overweight-ing asset classes with strong recent performance.
6.
 A i
s correct. McCall recommends a new IPS. Changes in the economic envi-
ronment and capital market expectations or changes in the beliefs of committee members are factors that may lead to an altering of the principles that guide investment activities. Because the plan is now overfunded, there is less need to take a higher level of equity risk. The Pension Committee is concerned about the impact of future market and economic risks on the funding status of the plan. Katt Company operates in a cyclical industry and could have difficulty making pension contributions during a recession. Therefore, a substantial reduction in the allocation to stocks and an increase in bonds reduce risk. The 40% stocks/60% bonds alternative increases the allocation to bonds from 35% to 60%. Increasing the fixed-income allocation should moderate plan risk, provide a better hedge for liabilities, and reduce contribution uncertainty.
7.
 B i
s correct. Using rules-based, quantitative signals, systematic tactical asset 
allocation (TAA) attempts to capture asset-class-level return anomalies that have been shown to have some predictability and persistence. Trend signals are widely

used in systematic TAA. A moving-average crossover is a trend signal that indi-
cates an upward (downward) trend when the moving average of the shorter time frame, 50 days, is above (below) the moving average of the longer time frame, 200 days.
8.
 A i
s correct. A lower annual spending rate, in addition to the board’s expectations 
of rising enrollment and minimal need for endowment support over the next five years, indicates a decreased need for liquidity. Therefore, KUE could justify an increase in the strategic allocation to less liquid asset classes (such as private real estate equity and infrastructure) and a decrease in the strategic allocation to liquid assets (such as investment-grade bonds).
9.
 A i
s correct. The Sharpe ratio is suitable for measuring the success of TAA 
relative to SAA. Specifically, the success of TAA decisions can be evaluated by comparing the Sharpe ratio realized under the TAA with the Sharpe ratio that would have been realized under the SAA.
10.
 A i
s correct. The forecast for expected excess returns is positive for developed 
markets equity and negative for infrastructure. Therefore, to attempt to profit from the short-term excess return forecast, KUE can overweight developed mar-kets equity and underweight infrastructure. These adjustments to the asset-class weights are within KUE’s lower and upper policy limits.
11.
 C i
s correct. As a general rule, the portion of a taxable asset owner’s assets that 
are eligible for lower tax rates and deferred capital gains tax treatment should first be allocated to the investor’s taxable accounts. Assets that generate returns mainly from interest income tend to be less tax efficient and in Koval’s country are taxed at progressively higher rates. Also, the standard deviation (volatility) of after-tax returns is lower when equities are held in a taxable account. Therefore, Koval’s taxable account would become more tax efficient if it held more domestic equities focused on long-term capital gain opportunities.
12.
 B i
s correct. Availability bias is an information-processing bias in which people 
take a mental shortcut when estimating the probability of an outcome based on how easily the outcome comes to mind. On the basis of the losses incurred by his family trust during the recent economic crisis, Koval expresses a strong preference for avoiding the emerging markets equity asset class. Such behavior is consistent with availability bias, where investors who personally experience an adverse event are likely to assign a higher probability to such an event occurring again.
13.
 B i
s correct. After-tax portfolio optimization requires adjusting each asset class’s 
expected return and risk for expected taxes. The correlation of returns is not affected by taxes and does not require an adjustment when performing after-tax portfolio optimization.

Loss  
AversionUnder loss-aversion bias, people strongly prefer avoiding losses as opposed to achieving gains and they assign a greater weight to potential negative outcomes than positive ones.  
Young’s strong emphasis on retirement security and her desire to avoid losing money indicates that she has a loss-aversion bias. This bias could interfere with her willingness to maintain ideal asset allo-cations during times of negative returns.
Illusion of Control  
Mental AccountingUnder mental accounting bias, people treat one sum of money differ -
ently from another sum based solely on the mental account to which the money is assigned.  
Young is considering her $3 million tax-deferred retirement account, her $500,000 account for the girls’ education, and the $400,000 emergency account separately, rather than seeing them all as a combined investable total. In doing this, she sets herself up for the possibility of sub-optimal allocation.

Portfolio 3 comes closest to meeting Young’s desire to earn at least 6% after tax per year 
without taking on additional incremental risk. Portfolio 3 offers a lower standard deviation 
than Portfolio 2, as summarized in Exhibit 3, while producing approximately the same 
return. Portfolio 1 achieves the highest returns but at a much greater level of volatility than 
Portfolio 3, not satisfying Young’s risk criterion.  
Given the $500,000 minimum investment requirement for alternative assets, at Young’s 
total portfolio size of $5.5 million, the suggested 5% allocation to private equity in Portfolio 
2 results in only a $275,000 exposure, insufficient to invest in private equity. Thus, Portfolio 
2, as presented, is not viable, whereas Portfolio 1, with a private equity investment of 
$550,000, meets the minimum requirement for alternative investments. This minimum 
investment requirement is not an issue for Portfolio 3 because it has no private equity 
component.

In addition, asset sales in the after-tax account result in taxes due. A wider target range allows more price movement before the rebalancing range is exceeded (and a decision must be made to initiate an asset sale, incur associated tax payments, and rebalance back to the target equity alloca-tion).  
The after-tax account range is calculated by adjusting the pre-tax range for taxes.

A change in constraints relates to material changes in constraints, such as time horizon, 
liquidity needs, asset size, and regulatory or other external constraints. In this case, Young’s 
circumstances have changed; she is considering accepting the offer and retiring five years 
sooner than she originally anticipated.  
A change in an investor’s personal circumstances that may alter her risk appetite or risk 
capacity is considered to be a change in goals . In this circumstance, Young’s risk appetite or 
risk capacity have not changed, whereas the time horizon associated with her goals has.  
A change in the investment beliefs or principles guiding an investor’s investment activities 
is considered to be a change in beliefs. In this circumstance, Young’s guiding principles have 
not changed.
Young decides to accept the retirement offer. Having very low liquidity needs, she 
wants to save part of the retirement payout for unforeseen costs that might occur more than a decade in the future. The broker’s view on long-term stock market prospects is positive and recommends additional equity investment.

Account Justification
Education  
Reallocated Money 
MarketAs a general rule, the portion of a taxable asset owner’s assets that is eligible for lower tax rates and deferred capital gains tax treatment should first be allocated to the investor’s taxable accounts. Equities should generally be held in taxable accounts, whereas taxable bonds and high turnover trading strategies should generally be located in tax-exempt and tax-deferred accounts.  
The reallocated money market account is a taxable account, whereas the retirement account is tax-deferred. The unexpected needs account requires liquidity (in case of unexpected needs), so it is better suited for shorter-term positions.  
Given the ages of Young’s two daughters, now 17 and 20, the edu-cation account is most likely currently funding college expenses and will be for the next several years. Accordingly, it needs to be invested in highly liquid assets to cover these costs.

19. The pr oposed asset allocation for Titan is not appropriate because:
1.
 Given t
he shift in enrollment trends and declining donations resulting from 
the sanctions, Titan will likely need greater liquidity in the future because 
of the increased probability of higher outflows to support university opera-tions. The proposed asset allocation shifts Titan’s allocation into risky assets (increases the relative equity holdings and decreases the relative bond hold-ings), which would introduce greater uncertainty as to their future value.
2.

declining enrollments and its resulting potential need for liquidity, private equity at this minimum level of investment is not appropriate for Titan.

 The pr
oposed asset allocation for Fordhart is inappropriate because:
1.
 Given t
he increasing enrollment trends and recent favorable legal settle-
ment, Fordhart will likely require lower liquidity in the future. The proposed allocation shifts Fordhart’s portfolio away from risky assets (decreases the relative equity holdings and increases the relative bond holdings).
2.
 The pr
oposed 10% allocation to private equity creates an overly concen-
trated position in the underlying investment. A 10% allocation to the CFQ Private Equity Fund is $200 million (10% of Fordhart’s $2 billion). The CFQ Private Equity Fund has assets under management (AUM) of $500 million. Hence, Fordhart would own 40% of the entire CFQ Private Equity Fund. This position exposes both Fordhart and the CFQ fund to an undesirable level of operational risk.
