How to Use the CFA 
Program Curriculum
The CFA® Program exams measure your mastery of the core knowledge, skills, and 
abilities required to succeed as an investment professional. These core competencies 
are the basis for the Candidate Body of Knowledge (CBOK™). The CBOK consists of 
four components:
A broad outline that lists the major CFA Program topic areas ( www  
.cfainstitute  .org/  programs/  cfa/ curriculum/  cbok/  cbok )
Topic area weights that indicate the relative exam weightings of the top-level 
topic areas ( www  .cfainstitute  .org/  en/ programs/  cfa/ curriculum )
Learning outcome statements (LOS) that advise candidates about the 
specific knowledge, skills, and abilities they should acquire from curricu -
lum content covering a topic area: LOS are provided at the beginning of 
each block of related content and the specific lesson that covers them. We 
encourage you to review the information about the LOS on our website 
(www  .cfainstitute  .org/  programs/  cfa/ curriculum/  study  -sessions ), including 
the descriptions of LOS “command words” on the candidate resources page 
at www  .cfainstitute  .org/ -/ media/  documents/  support/  programs/  cfa -and 
-cipm  -los -command  -words  .ashx .
The CFA Program curriculum that candidates receive access to upon exam 
registration
Therefore, the key to your success on the CFA exams is studying and understanding 
the CBOK. You can learn more about the CBOK on our website: www  .cfainstitute  
.org/  programs/  cfa/ curriculum/  cbok . 
The curriculum, including the practice questions, is the basis for all exam questions. 
The curriculum is selected or developed specifically to provide candidates with the 
knowledge, skills, and abilities reflected in the CBOK.
CFA INSTITUTE LEARNING ECOSYSTEM (LES)
Your exam registration fee includes access to the CFA Institute Learning Ecosystem 
(LES). This digital learning platform provides access, even offline, to all the curriculum 
content and practice questions. The LES is organized as a series of learning modules 
consisting of short online lessons and associated practice questions. This tool is your 
source for all study materials, including practice questions and mock exams. The LES 
is the primary method by which CFA Institute delivers your curriculum experience. 
Here, candidates will find additional practice questions to test their knowledge. Some 
questions in the LES provide a unique interactive experience.
DESIGNING YOUR PERSONAL STUDY PROGRAM
An orderly, systematic approach to exam preparation is critical. You should dedicate 
a consistent block of time every week to reading and studying. Review the LOS both 
before and after you study curriculum content to ensure you can demonstrate the 
How to Use the CFA Program Curriculum viii
knowledge, skills, and abilities described by the LOS and the assigned reading. Use 
the LOS as a self-check to track your progress and highlight areas of weakness for 
later review.
Successful candidates report an average of more than 300 hours preparing for each 
exam. Your preparation time will vary based on your prior education and experience, 
and you will likely spend more time on some topics than on others. 
ERRATA
The curriculum development process is rigorous and involves multiple rounds of 
reviews by content experts. Despite our efforts to produce a curriculum that is free of 
errors, in some instances, we must make corrections. Curriculum errata are periodically 
updated and posted by exam level and test date on the Curriculum Errata webpage 
(www  .cfainstitute  .org/  en/ programs/  submit  -errata ). If you believe you have found an 
error in the curriculum, you can submit your concerns through our curriculum errata 
reporting process found at the bottom of the Curriculum Errata webpage.

Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 4
INTRODUCTION
Derivatives are financial instruments through which counterparties agree to exchange 
economic cash flows based on the movement of underlying securities, indexes, cur -
rencies, or other instruments or factors. A derivative’s value is thus derived  from 
the economic performance of the underlying. Derivatives may be created directly by 
counterparties or may be facilitated through established, regulated market exchanges. 
Direct creation between counterparties has the benefit of tailoring to the counterparties’ 
specific needs but also the disadvantage of potentially low liquidity. Exchange-traded 
derivatives often do not match counterparties’ specific needs but do facilitate early 
termination of the position, and, importantly, mitigate counterparty risk. Derivatives 
facilitate the exchange of economic risks and benefits where trades in the underlying 
securities might be less advantageous because of poor liquidity, transaction costs, 
regulatory impediments, tax or accounting considerations, or other factors.
Options are an important type of contingent-claim derivative that provide their 
owner with the right but not an obligation to a payoff determined by the future price 
of the underlying asset. Unlike other types of derivatives (i.e., swaps, forwards, and 
futures), options have nonlinear payoffs that enable their owners to benefit from 
movements in the underlying in one direction without being hurt by movements 
in the opposite direction. The cost of this opportunity, however, is the upfront cash 
payment required to enter the options position.
Options can be combined with the underlying and with other options in a variety 
of different ways to modify investment positions, to implement investment strategies, 
or even to infer market expectations. Therefore, investment managers routinely use 
option strategies for hedging risk exposures, for seeking to profit from anticipated 
market moves, and for implementing desired risk exposures in a cost-effective manner.
The main purpose of this reading is to illustrate how options strategies are used 
in typical investment situations and to show the risk–return trade-offs associated 
with their use. Importantly, an informed investment professional should have such a 
basic understanding of options strategies to competently serve his investment clients.
Section 2 of this reading shows how certain combinations of securities (i.e., options, 
underlying) are equivalent to others. Sections 3–6 discuss two of the most widely used 
options strategies, covered calls and protective puts. In Sections 7 and 8, we look at 
popular spread and combination option strategies used by investors. The focus of 
Section 9 is implied volatility embedded in option prices and related volatility skew 
and surface. Section 10 discusses option strategy selection. Sections 11 and 12 demon -
strate a series of applications showing ways in which an investment manager might 
solve an investment problem with options. The reading concludes with a summary.
POSITION EQUIVALENCIES
demonstrate how an asset’s returns may be replicated by using 
options
It is useful to think of derivatives as building blocks that can be combined to create 
a specific payoff with the desired risk exposure. A synthetic position can be created 
for any option or stock strategy. Most of the time, market participants use synthetic 
positions to transform the payoff profile of their positions when their market views 1

change. We cover a few of these relationships in the following pages. First, a brief 
recap of put–call parity and put–call–forward parity will help readers to understand 
such synthetic positions.
As you may remember, put–call parity shows the equivalence (or parity) of a 
portfolio of a call and a risk-free bond with a portfolio of a put and the underlying, 
which leads to the relationship between put and call prices. Put–call parity can be 
expressed in the following formula, where S0 is the price of the underlying; p0 and c0 
are the prices (i.e., premiums) of the put and call options, respectively; and X/(1 + r)
T is the present value of the risk-free bond: S0 + p0 = c0 + X/(1 + r)T.
A closely related concept is put–call–forward parity, which identifies the equiva -
lence between buying a fiduciary call, given by the purchase of a call and the risk-free 
bond, and a synthetic protective put. The latter involves the purchase of a put option 
and a forward contract on the underlying that expires at the same time as the put 
option. In the put–call–forward parity formula, S0 is replaced with a forward contract 
to buy the underlying, where the forward price is given by F0(T) = S0(1 + r)T. Therefore, 
put–call–forward parity is: F0(T)/(1 + r)T + p0 = c0 + X/(1 + r)T.
Synthetic Forward Position
The combination of a long call and a short put with identical strike price and expiration, 
traded at the same time on the same underlying, is equivalent to a synthetic long 
forward position . In fact, the long call creates the upside and the short put creates 
the downside on the underlying.
Consider an investor who buys an at-the-money (ATM) call and simultaneously 
sells a put with the same strike and the same expiration date. Whatever the stock 
price at expiration, one of the two options will be in the money. If the contract has 
a physical settlement, the investor will buy the underlying stock by paying the strike 
price. In fact, on the expiration date, the investor will exercise the call she owns if the 
stock price is above the strike price. Otherwise, if the underlying price is below the 
strike price, the put owner will exercise his right to deliver the stock and the investor 
(who sold the put) must buy it for the strike price. Exhibit 1  shows the values of the 
two options and the combined position at expiration, compared with the value of 
the stock purchase at that same time. The stock in this case does not pay dividends.
Exhibit 1: Synthetic Long Forward Position at Expiration
Stock price at expiration: 40 50 60
Alternative 1:      
Long 50-strike call payoff 0 0 10
Short 50-strike put payoff −10 0 0
Total value −10 0 10
Alternative 2:      
Long stock at 50 −10 0 10
Total value −10 0 10
We now compare the same option strategy with the payoff of a forward or futures 
contract in Exhibit 2 . The motivation to create a synthetic long forward position could 
be to exploit an arbitrage opportunity presented by the actual forward price or the 
need for an alternative to the outright purchase of a long forward position. Frequently, 
a forward contract is used instead of futures to acquire a stock position because it 
allows for contract customization.

EXAMPLE 1
Synthetic Long Forward Position vs. Long Forward/
Futures
A market maker has sold a three-month forward contract on Vodafone that 
allows the client (counterparty) to buy 10,000 shares at 200.35 pence (100p = 
£1) at expiration. The current stock price ( S0) is 200p, and the stock does not 
pay dividends until after the contract matures. The annualized interest rate is 
0.70%. The cost (i.e., premium) of puts and calls on Vodafone is identical.
1. Discuss (a) how the market maker can hedge her short forward position 
upon the sale of the forward contract and (b) the market maker’s position 
upon expiration of the forward contract.
Solution:
a. To offset the short forward contract position, the market maker can 
borrow ₤20,000 (= 10,000 × S0/100) and buy 10,000 Vodafone shares 
at 200p. There is no upfront cost because the stock purchase is 100% 
financed.
b. At the expiry of the forward contract, the market maker delivers the 
10,000 Vodafone shares she owns to the client that is long the forward, 
and then the market maker repays her loan. The net outflow for the 
market maker is zero because the following two transactions offset 
each other:
 Amount received for the delivery of shares: 10,000 × 200.35p = £20,035
 Repayment of loan: 10,000 × 200p [1 + 0.700% × (90/360)] = £20,035
Position Equivalencies 7
2. Discuss how the market maker can hedge her short forward contract posi -
tion using a synthetic long forward position, and explain what happens at 
expiry if the Vodafone share price is above or below 200.35p.
Solution:
To hedge her short forward position, the market maker creates a synthetic 
long forward position. She purchases a call and sells a put, both with a strike 
price of 200.35p and expiring in three months.
At the expiry of the forward contract, if the stock price is above 200.35p, 
the market maker exercises her call, pays £20,035 (=10,000 × 200.35p), and 
receives 10,000 Vodafone shares. She then delivers these shares to the client 
and receives £20,035.
At the expiry of the forward contract, if the stock price is below 200.35p, 
the owner of the long put will exercise his option, and the market maker 
receives the 10,000 Vodafone shares for £20,035. She then delivers these 
shares to the client and receives £20,035.
Consider now a trader who wants to short a stock over a specified period. He needs 
to borrow the stock from the market and then sell the borrowed shares. Instead, the 
trader can create a synthetic short forward position  by selling a call and buying a 
put at the same strike price and maturity. When using options to replicate a short 
stock position, it is important to be aware of early assignment risk that could arise 
with American-style options. As Exhibit 3  shows, the payoff is the exact opposite of 
the synthetic long forward position.
The same outcome can be achieved be selling forwards or futures contracts (as 
seen in Exhibit 3 ). These instruments are also commonly used to eliminate future price 
risk. Consider an investor who owns a stock and wants to lock in a future sales price. 
The investor might enter into a forward or futures contract (as seller) requiring her 
to deliver the shares at a future date in exchange for a cash amount determined today. 
Because the initial and final stock prices are known, this investment should pay the 
risk-free rate. For a dividend-paying stock, the dividends expected to be paid on the 
stock during the term of the contract will decrease the price of the forward or futures.
Exhibit 3: Synthetic Short Forward Position
Stock price at expiration: 40 50 60
Alternative 1:      
Short 50-strike call payoff 0 0 −10
Long 50-strike put payoff 10 0 0
Total value 10 0 −10
Alternative 2:      
Short stock at 50 10 0 −10
Value 10 0 −10
Alternative 3:      
Short forward/futures at 50 10 0 −10
Value 10 0 −10
Synthetic forwards on stocks and equity indexes are often used by market makers 
that have sold a forward contract to customers—to hedge the risk, the market-maker 
would implement a synthetic long forward position—or by investment banks wishing 
to hedge forward exposure arising from structured products.
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 8
Synthetic Put and Call
As already described, market participants can use synthetic positions to transform 
the payoff and risk profile of their positions. The symmetrical payoffs of long and 
short stock, forward, and futures positions can be altered by implementing synthetic 
options positions. For example, the symmetric payoff of a short stock position can 
become asymmetrical if the investor transforms it into a synthetic long put position 
by buying a call.
Exhibit 4  shows the payoffs of a synthetic long put position that consists of short 
stock at 50 and a long call with an exercise price of 50. It can be seen that the pay -
offs from this synthetic put position at various stock prices at option expiration are 
identical to those of a long put with a 50-strike price. Of course, all positions are 
assumed to expire at the same time. Note that the same transformation of payoff and 
risk profile for a position of short forwards or futures can also be accomplished using 
long call options.

EXAMPLE 2
Synthetic Long Put
Three months ago, Wing Tan, a hedge fund manager, entered into a short for -
ward contract that requires him to deliver 50,000 Generali shares, which the 
fund does not currently own, at €18/share in one month from now. The stock 
price is currently €16/share. The hedge fund’s research analyst, Gisele Rossi, has 
a non-consensus expectation that the company will report an earnings “beat” 
next month. The stock does not pay dividends.
1. Under the assumption that Tan maintains the payoff profile of his current 
short forward position, discuss the conditions for profit or loss at contract 
expiration.
Solution:
If Tan decides to keep the current payoff profile of his position, at the expiry 
date, given a stock price of ST, the profit or loss on the short forward will be 
50,000 × (€18 − ST). The position will be profitable only if ST is below €18; 
otherwise the manager will incur in a loss.
2. After discussing with Rossi her earnings outlook, Tan remains bearish on 
Generali. He decides to hedge his risk, however, in case the stock does 
Covered Calls and Protective Puts 9
report a positive earnings surprise. Discuss how Tan can modify his existing 
position to produce an asymmetrical, risk-reducing payoff.
Solution:
Tan decides to modify the payoff profile on his short forward position so 
that, at expiration, it will benefit from any stock price decrease below €16 
while avoiding losses if the stock rises above that price. He purchases a call 
option with a strike price €16 and one month to maturity at a cost (premi -
um) of €0.50. At expiration, the payoffs are as follows:
 ■On the short forward contract: 50,000 × (€18 − ST)
 ■On the long call: 50,000 × {Max[0,( ST − €16)] − €0.50}
 ■On the combined position: 50,000 × {(€18 − ST) + [Max[0,( ST − €16)] 
− €0.50]}
If ST ≤ €16, the call will expire worthless and the profit will amount to 50,000 
× (€18 − ST + 0 − €0.50).
If ST > €16, the call is exercised and the Generali shares delivered for a maxi -
mum profit of 50,000 × (€18 − €16 − €0.50) = €75,000.
In similar fashion, an investor with a long stock position can change his payoff  
and risk profile into that of a long call by purchasing a put (“protective put” strategy). 
The long put eliminates the downside risk, whereas the long stock leaves the profit 
potential unlimited. As shown in Exhibit 5 , the strategy has a payoff profile resembling 
that of a long call. Again, all positions are assumed to expire at the same time. We 
will have much more to say about the protective put strategy later in this reading. 
Finally, the payoff profile of a long call can also be achieved by adding a long put to 
a long forward or futures position, all with the same expiration dates and the same 
strike and forward (or futures) prices.

COVERED CALLS AND PROTECTIVE PUTS
discuss the investment objective(s), structure, payoff, risk(s), value 
at expiration, profit, maximum profit, maximum loss, and breakeven 
underlying price at expiration of a covered call position3
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 10
Writing a covered call  is a very common option strategy used by both individual and 
institutional investors. In this strategy, a party that already owns shares sells a call 
option, giving another party the right to buy their shares at the exercise price.1 The 
investor owns the shares and has taken on the potential obligation to deliver the shares 
to the call option buyer and accept the exercise price as the price at which she sells the 
shares. For her willingness to do this, the investor receives the premium on the option.
When someone simultaneously holds a long position in an asset and a long position 
in a put option on that asset, the put is often called a protective put . The name comes 
from the fact that the put protects against losses in the value of the underlying asset.
The examples that follow use the convention of identifying an option by the under -
lying asset, expiration, exercise price, and option type. For example, in Exhibit 6 , the 
PBR October 16 call option sells for 1.42. The underlying asset is Petróleo Brasileiro 
(PBR) common stock, the expiration is October, the exercise price is 16, the option 
is a call, and the call premium is 1.42. It is important to note that even though we 
will refer to this as the October 16 option, it does not expire on 16 October. Rather, 
16 reflects the price at which the call owner has the right to buy, otherwise known as 
the exercise price or strike.
Petróleo Brasileiro (PBR) October 16 Call
Underlying asset Expiration Exercise price Option type
On some exchanges, certain options may have weekly expirations in addition to a 
monthly expiration, which means investors need to be careful in specifying the option 
of interest. For a given underlying asset and exercise price, there may be several weekly 
and one monthly option expiring in October. The examples that follow all assume a 
single monthly expiration.
Investment Objectives of Covered Calls
Consider the option data in Exhibit 6 . Suppose there is one month until the September 
expiration. By convention, option listings show data for a single call or put, but in 
practice, the most common trading unit for an exchange-traded option is one contract 
covering 100 shares. Besides call and put premiums for various strike (i.e., exercise) 
prices and monthly expirations, the option data also shows implied volatilities as well 
as the “Greeks” (variables so named because most of the common ones are denoted 
by Greek letters). Implied volatility is the value of the unobservable volatility variable 
that equates the result of an option pricing model—such as the Black–Scholes–Merton 
(BSM) model—to the market price of an option, using all other required (and observ -
able) input variables, including the option’s strike price, the price of the underlying, 
the time to option expiration, and the risk-free interest. Before proceeding further, 
we provide a brief review of the Greeks because they will be an integral part of the 
discussion of the various option strategies to be presented.
 ■Delta  (Δ) is the change in an option’s price in response to a change in price 
of the underlying, all else equal. Delta provides a good approximation of 
how an option’s price will change for a small change in the underlying’s 
price. Delta for long calls is always positive; delta for long puts is always neg -
ative. Delta (Δ) ≈ Change in value of option/Change in value of underlying.
1 When someone creates (writes) a call without owning the underlying asset, it is known as a “naked” call.
Covered Calls and Protective Puts 11
 ■Gamma  (Γ) is the change in an option’s delta for a change in price of the 
underlying, all else equal. Gamma is a measure of the curvature in the 
option price in relationship to the underlying price. Gamma for long calls 
and long puts is always positive. Gamma (Γ) ≈ Change in delta/Change in 
value of underlying.
 ■Vega  (ν) is the change in an option’s price for a change in volatility of the 
underlying, all else equal. Vega measures the sensitivity of the underlying 
to volatility. Vega for long calls and long puts is always positive. Vega (ν ) ≈ 
Change in value of option/Change in volatility of underlying.
 ■Theta  (Θ) is the daily change in an option’s price, all else equal. Theta mea -
sures the sensitivity of the option’s price to the passage of time, known as 
time decay. Theta for long calls and long puts is generally negative.
Assume the current PBR share price is 15.84 and the risk-free rate is 4%. Now let 
us consider three different market participants who might logically use covered calls.

Covered Calls and Protective Puts 13
Market Participant #1: Yield Enhancement
The most common motivation for writing covered calls is cash generation in antic -
ipation of limited upside moves in the underlying. The call option writer keeps the 
premium regardless of what happens in the future. Some covered call writers view the 
premium they receive as an additional source of income in the same way they view 
cash dividends. For a covered call, a long position in 100 shares of the underlying is 
required for each short call contract. No additional cash margin is needed if the long 
position in the underlying is maintained. If the stock price exceeds the strike price at 
expiry, the underlying shares will be “called away” from the covered call writer and 
then delivered to satisfy the option holder’s right to buy shares at the strike price. 
It is important to recognize, however, that when someone writes a call option, he is 
essentially giving up the returns above the strike price to the call holder.
Consider an individual investor who owns PBR and believes the stock price is 
likely to remain relatively flat over the next few months. With the stock currently 
trading at just under 16, the investor might think it unlikely that the stock will rise 
above 17. Exhibit 6  shows that the premium for a call option expiring in September 
with an exercise price of 17, referred to as the SEP 17 call, is 0.51. She could write 
that call and receive this premium. Alternatively, she could write a different call, say 
the NOV 17 call, and receive 1.44. There is a clear trade-off between the size of the 
option premium and the likelihood of option exercise. The option writer would get 
more cash from writing the longer-term option (because of a larger time premium), 
but there is a greater chance that the option would move in the money, resulting in 
the option being exercised by the buyer and, therefore, the stock being called away 
from the writer. The view of the covered call writer can be understood in terms of the 
call option’s implied volatility. Essentially, writing the call expresses the view that the 
volatility of the underlying asset will be lower than the pricing of the option suggests. 
As shown in Exhibit 6 , the implied volatility of the NOV 17 options is 58.36%. By 
writing the NOV 17 call for 1.44, the covered call investor believes that the volatility of 
the underlying asset will be less than the option’s implied volatility of 58.36%. The call 
buyer believes the stock will move far enough above the strike price of 17 to provide 
a payoff greater than the 1.44 cost of the call.
Although it may be acceptable to think of the option premium as income, it is 
important to remember that the call writer has given up an important benefit of stock 
ownership: capital gains above the strike price. This dynamic can be seen in Exhibit 7 . 
Consider an investor with a long position in PBR stock (with delta of +1) and a short 
position in a PBR NOV 17 call. The investor enjoys the benefit of the call premium of 
1.44. This cushions the value of the position (Stock − Call, or S − C) as the PBR share 
price drops. If the PBR stock price drops to 5, the call option will drop to essentially 
0. The portfolio will be worth about 6.44, as shown in Exhibit 7 . As the stock price 
increases, however, the short call position begins to limit portfolio gains. If the price 
of PBR shares rises to 30, the call option delta approaches 1, so the delta of the port -
folio (S − C) approaches 0. The portfolio gains from the long PBR stock position will 
be reduced by losses on the short call position. As the in-the-money option expires, 
the maximum value of the portfolio will approach 18.44, the exercise price of 17 plus 
the 1.44 premium, as in Exhibit 7 .

PBR Stock Price
Market Participant #2: Reducing a Position at a Favorable Price
Next, consider Sofia Porto, a retail portfolio manager with a portfolio that has become 
overweighted in energy companies. She wants to reduce this imbalance. Porto holds 
5,000 shares of PBR, an energy company, and she expects the price of this stock to 
remain relatively stable over the next month. She may decide to sell 1,000 shares for 
15.84 each. As an alternative, Porto might decide to write 10 exchange-traded PBR SEP 
15 call contracts. This means she is creating 10 option contracts, each of which covers 
100 shares. In exchange for this contingent claim, she receives the option premium of 
1.64/call × 100 calls/contract × 10 contracts = 1,640. Because the current PBR stock 
price (15.84) is above the exercise price of 15, the options she writes are in the money. 
Given her expectation that the stock price will be stable over the next month, it is likely 
that the option will be exercised. Because Porto wants to reduce the overweighting 
in energy stocks, this outcome is desirable. If the option is exercised, she has effec -
tively sold the stock at 16.64. She receives 1.64 when she writes the option, and she 
receives 15 when the option is exercised. Porto could have simply sold the shares at 
their original price of 15.84, but in this specific situation, the option strategy resulted 
in a price improvement of 0.80 ([15 + 1.64] − 15.84) per share, or 5.05% (0.80/15.84), 
in a month’s time.2 By maintaining the stock position and selling a 15 call, she still 
risks the possibility of a stock price decline during the coming month resulting in a 
realized price lower than the current market price of 15.84. For example, if the PBR 
share price declined to 10 over the next month, Porto would realize only 10 + 1.64 
=11.64 on her covered call position.
An American option premium can be viewed as having two parts: exercise value 
(also called intrinsic value) and time value.3
 Call Premium = Time Value + Intrinsic Value = Time Value + Max(0, S − X)
2 Porto’s effective selling price of 16.64 is 0.80 higher than the original price of 15.84: 0.80/15.84 = 5.05%.
3 In addition to exercise value, some use the term “economic value” for intrinsic value because it is the 
value of the option if the investor were to exercise it at this very moment and trade out of the stock position.
Covered Calls and Protective Puts 15
In this case, the right to buy at 15 when the stock price is 15.84 has an exercise (or 
intrinsic) value of 0.84. The option premium is 1.64, which is 0.80 more than the 
exercise value. This difference of 0.80 is called time value.
 1.64 = Time Value + (15.84 − 15)
Someone who writes covered calls to improve on the market is capturing the time 
value, which augments the stock selling price. Remember, though, that giving up part 
of the return distribution would result in an opportunity loss if the underlying goes up.
Market Participant #3: Target Price Realization
A third popular use of options is really a hybrid of the first two objectives. This 
strategy involves writing calls with an exercise price near the target price for the 
stock. Suppose a bank trust department holds PBR in many of its accounts and that 
its research team believes the stock would be properly priced at 16 per share, which 
is only slightly higher than its current price. In those accounts for which the invest -
ment policy statement permits option activity, the manager might choose to write 
near-term calls with an exercise price near the target price, 16 in this case. Suppose 
an account holds 500 shares of PBR. Writing 5 SEP 16 call contracts at 0.97 brings in 
485 in cash. If the stock is above 16 in a month, the stock will be called away at the 
strike price (target price), with the option premium adding an additional 6% positive 
return to the account.4 If PBR fails to rise to 16, the manager might write a new OCT 
expiration call with the same objective in mind.
Although this strategy is popular, the investor should not view it as a source of free 
money. The stock is currently very close to the target price, and the manager could 
simply sell it and be satisfied. Although the covered call writing program potentially 
adds to the return, there is also the chance that the stock could experience bad news 
or the overall market might pull back, resulting in an opportunity loss relative to the 
outright sale of the stock. The investor also would have an opportunity loss if the stock 
rose sharply above the exercise price and it was called away at a lower-than-market 
price.
The exposure from the short position in the PBR SEP 16 call can be understood in 
terms of the Greeks in Exhibit 6 . Delta measures how the option price changes as the 
underlying asset price changes, and gamma measures the rate of change in delta.5 A 
PBR SEP 16 call has a delta = 0.516 and a gamma of 0.156. A short call will reduce the 
delta of the portfolio (S − C) from +1 to +0.484 (= +1[Share] − 0.516[Short Call]). The 
lower portfolio delta will reduce the upside opportunity. A share price increase of 1 
will result in a portfolio gain of approximately 0.484.6 The delta of the portfolio is not 
constant. By selling the PBR 16 call, the portfolio is now “short gamma” . Remember, 
gamma is the rate of change of delta. Although the underlying PBR share has a gamma 
of 0, the short call will make the gamma of the portfolio −0.156. As the price of PBR 
shares increases above 16, the delta of the PBR call position will change, at a rate of 
gamma. Gamma is greatest for a near-the-money option and becomes progressively 
smaller as the option moves either into or out of the money (as seen in Exhibit 8 ).
Gamma of an ATM option can increase dramatically as the time to expiration 
approaches or volatility increases. Traders with large gamma exposure (especially large 
negative gamma) should be aware of the speed with which the position values can 
change. The change in portfolio delta and gamma for a PBR SEP 16 covered call as a 
function of share price can be seen in Exhibit 8 . As the price of PBR shares increase, 
4 Relative to a stock price of 16, the option premium of 0.97 is 0.97/16 = 6.06%.
5 Delta is the calculus first derivative of the option price with respect to the underlying asset price. Gamma 
is the second derivative of the option price with respect to the underlying asset price.
6 The delta approximates the portfolio price change for very small changes in the underlying price. The delta 
itself is changing at a rate of gamma. For a change as large as 1%, the actual portfolio value will increase 
at a rate of less than 0.484 because it is short gamma.
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 16
the portfolio delta changes at a rate of gamma. As the share price moves above the 
exercise price of 16, the portfolio (S − C) delta drops at a rate gamma towards its 
eventual limit of 0, effectively eliminating any remaining upside in the position.

PBR Shar e Price
Profit and Loss at Expiration
In the process of learning option strategies, it is always helpful to look at a graphical 
display of the profit and loss possibilities at the option expiration. Suppose an inves -
tor owns PBR, currently trading at 15.84. The investor believes gains may be limited 
above a price of 17 and decides to write a call against the long share position. The 17 
strike calls will have no intrinsic value because the share price is currently 15.84. The 
investor must now consider the available option maturities (SEP , OCT, and NOV) as 
shown in Exhibit 6 . In deciding which option to write, the investor may consider the 
option premiums and implied volatilities. Based on the investor’s view that volatility 
will remain low over the next three months, the investor chooses to write the NOV 
call. At 58.36%, the NOV 17 call has highest implied volatility of the available 17 strike 
options, so it would be the most overvalued assuming low volatility. The option pre -
mium of 1.44 is completely explained by the time value of the NOV option, because 
the NOV 17 option has no exercise value (Option premium = Time value + Intrinsic 
value; 1.44 = Time value + Max[0,15.84 − 17]). If the stock is above 17 at expiration, 
the option holder will exercise the call option and the investor will deliver the shares 
in exchange for the exercise price of 17. The maximum gain with a covered call is the 
appreciation to the exercise price plus the option premium.7
7 If someone writes an in-the-money covered call, there is “depreciation” to the exercise price, so the 
difference would be subtracted. For instance, if the stock price is 50 and a 45 call sells for 7, the maximum 
gain is −(50 − 45) + 7 = 2.
Covered Calls and Protective Puts 17
Some symbols will be helpful in learning these relationships:
 S0 = Stock price when option position opened
 ST = Stock price at option expiration
 X  = Option exercise price
 c0 = Call premium received or paid
The maximum gain is ( X − S0) + c0. With a starting price of 15.84, a sale price 
of 17 results in 1.16 of price appreciation. The option writer would keep the option 
premium of 1.44 for a total gain of 1.16 + 1.44 = 2.60. This is the maximum gain 
from this strategy because all price appreciation above 17 belongs to the call holder. 
The call writer keeps the option premium regardless of what the stock does, so if it 
were to drop, the overall loss is reduced by the option premium received. Exhibit 9  
shows the situation. The breakeven price for a covered call is the stock price minus 
the premium, or S0 − c0. In other words, the breakeven point occurs when the stock 
falls by the premium received—in this example, 15.84 − 1.44 = 14.40. The maximum 
loss would occur if the stock became worthless; it equals the original stock price 
minus the option premium received, or S0 − c0.8 In this single unlikely scenario, the 
investor would lose 15.84 on the stock position but still keep the premium of 1.44, 
for a total loss of 14.40.
At option expiration, the value  of the covered call position is the stock price minus 
the exercise value of the call. Any appreciation beyond the exercise price belongs 
to the option buyer, so the covered call writer does not earn any gains beyond that 
point. Symbolically,
 Covered Call Expiration Value = ST − Max[( ST − X),0]. (1)
The profit  at option expiration is the covered call value plus the option premium 
received minus the original price of the stock:
 Covered Call Profit at Expiration = ST − Max[( ST − X),0] + c0 − S0. (2)
In summary:
 Maximum gain = ( X − S0) + c0
 Maximum loss = S0 − c0
 Breakeven price = S0 − c0
 Expiration value = ST − Max[( ST − X),0]
 Profit at expiration = ST − Max[( ST − X),0] + c0 − S0
8 Note that with a covered call, the breakeven price and the maximum loss are the same value.

It is important to remember that these profit and loss diagrams depict the situation 
only at the end of the option’s life.9 Most equity covered call writing occurs with 
exchange-traded options, so the call writer always has the ability to buy back the 
option before expiration. If, for instance, the PBR stock price were to decline by 1 
shortly after writing the covered call, the call value would most likely also decline. If 
this investor correctly believed the decline was temporary, he might buy the call back 
at the new lower option premium, making a profit on that trade, and then write the 
option again after the share price recovered.
EXAMPLE 3
Characteristics of Covered Calls
S0 = Stock price when option position opened = 25.00
X = Option exercise price = 30.00
ST = Stock price at option expiration = 31.33
c0 = Call premium received = 1.55
1. Which of the following correctly calculates the maximum gain from writing 
a covered call?
A. (ST − X) + c0 = 31.33 − 30.00 + 1.55 = 2.88
B. (ST − S0) − c0 = 31.33 − 25.00 −1.55 = 4.78
C. (X − S0) + c0 = 30.00 − 25.00 + 1.55 = 6.55
Solution:
C is correct. The covered call writer participates in gains up to the exercise 
price, after which further appreciation is lost to the call buyer. That is, X − S0 
= 30.00 − 25.00 = 5.00. The call writer also keeps c0, the option premium, 
which is 1.55. So, the total maximum gain is 5.00 + 1.55 = 6.55.
9 It is also important to note that the general shape of the profit and loss diagram for a covered call is 
the same as that of writing a put. Covered call writing is the most common use of options by individual 
investors, whereas writing puts is the least common.
Investment Objectives of Protective Puts 19
2. Which of the following correctly calculates the breakeven stock price from 
writing a covered call?
A. S0 − c0 = 25.00 − 1.55 = 23.45
B. ST − c0 = 31.33 − 1.55 = 29.78
C. X + c0 = 30.00 + 1.55 = 31.55
Solution:
A is correct. The call premium of 1.55 offsets a decline in the stock price by 
the amount of the premium received: 25.00 − 1.55 = 23.45.
3. Which of the following correctly calculates the maximum loss from writing 
a covered call?
A. S0 − c0 = 25.00 − 1.55 = 23.45
B. ST − c0 = 31.33 − 1.55 = 29.78
C. ST − X + c0 = 31.33 − 30.00 + 1.55 = 2.88
Solution:
A is correct. The stock price can fall to zero, causing a loss of the entire 
investment, but the option writer still keeps the option premium received: 
25.00 − 1.55 = 23.45
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES OF PROTECTIVE PUTS
discuss the investment objective(s), structure, payoff, risk(s), value 
at expiration, profit, maximum profit, maximum loss, and breakeven 
underlying price at expiration of a protective put position
The protective put is often viewed as a classic example of buying insurance. The investor 
holds a risky asset and wants protection against a loss in value. He then buys insurance 
in the form of the put, paying a premium to the seller of the insurance, the put writer. 
The exercise price of the put is similar to the coverage amount for an insurance policy. 
The insurance policy deductible is similar to the difference between the current asset 
price and the strike price of the put. A protective put with a low exercise price is like 
an insurance policy with a high deductible. Although less expensive, a low strike put 
involves greater price exposure before the payoff function goes into the money. For an 
insurance policy, a higher deductible is less expensive and reflects the increased risk 
borne by the insured party. For a protective put, a lower exercise price is less costly 
and has a greater risk of loss in the position.
Like traditional term insurance, this form of insurance provides coverage for a 
period of time. At the end of the period, the insurance expires and either pays off or 
not. The buyer of the insurance may or may not choose to renew the insurance by 
buying another put. A protective put can appear to be a great transaction with no 
drawbacks, because it provides downside protection with upside potential, but let us 
take a closer look.4
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 20
Loss Protection/Upside Preservation
Suppose a portfolio manager has a client with a 50,000 share position in PBR. Her 
research suggests there may be a negative shock to the stock price in the next four 
to six weeks, and he wants to guard against a price decline. Consider the put prices 
shown in Exhibit 6 ; the purchase of a protective put presents the manager with some 
choices. Puts represent a right to sell at the strike price, so higher-strike puts will 
be more expensive. For this reason, the put buyer may select the 15-strike PBR put. 
Longer-term American puts are more expensive than their equivalent (same strike 
price) shorter-maturity puts. The put buyer must be sure the put will not expire 
before the expected price shock has occurred. The portfolio manager could buy a 
one-month (SEP) 15-strike put for 0.65. This put insures against the portion of the 
underlying return distribution that is below 15, but it will not protect against a price 
shock occurring after the SEP expiration.
Alternatively, the portfolio manager could buy a two-month option, paying 0.99 
for an OCT 15 put, or she could buy a three-month option, paying 1.46 for a NOV 15 
put. Note that there is not a linear relationship between the put value and its time until 
expiration. A two-month option does not sell for twice the price of a one-month option, 
nor does a three-month option sell for three times the price of a one-month option. 
The portfolio manager can also reduce the cost of insurance by increasing the size of 
the deductible (i.e., the current stock price minus the put exercise price), perhaps by 
using a put option with a 14 exercise price. A put option with an exercise price of 14 
would have a lower premium but would not protect against losses in the stock until 
it falls to 14.00 per share. The option price is cheaper, but on a 50,000 share position, 
the deductible would be 50,000 more than if the exercise price of 15 were selected.10
Because of the uncertainty about the timing of the “shock event” she anticipates, the 
manager might consider the characteristics of the available option maturities. Given 
our assumptions, three of the BSM model inputs for the available 15 strike options are 
the same (PBR stock price 15.84, the strike price 15 and the risk-free rate of interest 
4%). The difference in the cost of the SEP , OCT, and NOV options will be explained by 
the differences in time and the term structure of volatility. The BSM model assumes 
option volatility does not change over time or with strike price. In practice, volatility 
can vary across time and strike prices. For the 15 puts, the implied volatility is slightly 
greater for the NOV option, perhaps reflecting other traders’ concerns about a shock 
event before expiration. Because the PBR stock price is 15.84 and the put options are 
all 15 strike, all three maturities have no intrinsic value.
The cost of each PBR 15 strike option is entirely explained by the remaining time 
value. If the stock price does not fall below 15, the SEP , OCT, and NOV put option 
values will erode to 0 as they approach their expiration dates. The erosion of the 
options value with time is approximated by the theta. The daily thetas (Theta/365) 
for the PBR puts and calls are given in Exhibit 6 . Notice, all the theta values in the 
table are negative. These values approximate the daily losses on the option positions 
as time passes, all else equal. The NOV 15 put (90 days) has a theta of −0.009 and the 
SEP 15 put (30 days) has a theta of −0.015. If the NOV 15 option is held for one day, 
and the price and volatility of the underlying do not change, the put value will decline 
by approximately 0.009 to approximately 1.45 (= 1.46 − 0.009).
The graph of the BSM theta function for the PBR NOV 15 option as it approaches 
maturity is shown in Exhibit 10 . Notice how the rate of decline changes as maturity 
approaches. If the PBR price does not drop below 15, the NOV 15 put will expire 
out-of-the-money and the option price will gradually fall to 0. All else equal, the 
sum of the daily losses approximated by theta will explain the entire loss of 1.46 
10 The deductible is 50,000 × (15.84 − 15.00) with a strike price of 15. With a strike price of 14, the deduct -
ible would be 50,000 × (15.84 − 14.00), or 50,000 more.

in option value over that time. The complex shape of the theta graph in Exhibit 10  
results from the nature of the BSM theta formula, which includes terms to reflect the 
probability that the stock price will fall below the strike price during the remaining 
time. Note that if the price of PBR remains at 15.84 for the last 10 days to maturity, 
the BSM put option value will erode to 0 at varying rates averaging about −0.03/day. 
Assumptions of the BSM model explain the negative peak in theta around three days 
prior to maturity as the remaining time value rapidly decays to 0. Theta values might 
help the investor decide which maturity to choose. If he were to buy the cheaper SEP 
put, the daily erosion of value (−0.015) would be greater than for the more expensive 
NOV put (−0.009).

Days to Maturity
Given the four- to six-week time horizon for the shock event anticipated by the port -
folio manager, the OCT put seems appropriate, but there is still the potential to lose 
the premium without realizing any benefit. With a 0.99 premium for the OCT 15 put 
and 50,000 shares to protect, the cost to the account would be almost 50,000. One 
advantage of the NOV option is that although it is more expensive, it has the smallest 
daily loss of value, as captured by theta. This option also has a greater likelihood of 
not having expired before the news hits. Also, although the portfolio manager could 
hold onto the put position until its expiration, she might find it preferable to close out 
the option prior to maturity and recover some of the premium paid.11
11 A price shock to the underlying asset might increase the market’s expectations of future volatility, thereby 
likely increasing the put premium. By selling the option early, the investor would capture this increase. 
Also, once the adverse event occurred, there may be no reason to continue to hold the insurance. If the 
investor no longer needs it, he should cancel it and get part of the purchase price back. In other words, he 
should sell the put and recapture some of its cost.

Profit and Loss at Expiration
Exhibit 11  shows the profit and loss diagram for the protective put.12 The stock can 
rise to any level, and the position would benefit fully from the appreciation; the maxi -
mum gain is unlimited. On the downside, losses are “cut off” once the stock price falls 
to the exercise price. With a protective put, the maximum loss is the depreciation to 
the exercise price plus the premium paid, or S0 − X + p0. At the option expiration, 
the value of the protective put is the greater of the stock price or the exercise price. 
The reason is because the stock can rise to any level but has a floor value of the put 
exercise price. In symbols,
 Value of Protective Put at Expiration = ST + Max[( X − ST),0]. (3)
The profit or loss at expiration is the ending value minus the beginning value. The 
initial value of the protective put is the starting stock price minus the put premium. 
In symbols,
 Profit of Protective Put at Expiration = ST + Max[( X − ST),0] − S0 − p0. (4)

To break even, the underlying asset must rise by enough to offset the price of the 
put that was purchased. The breakeven point is the initial stock price plus the option 
premium. In symbols, Breakeven Price = S0 + p0.
In summary:
 Maximum gain = ST − S0 − p0 = Unlimited
 Maximum loss = S0 − X + p0
 Breakeven price = S0 + p0
 Expiration value = ST + Max[( X − ST),0]
 Profit at expiration = ST + Max[( X − ST),0] − S0 − p0
12 Note that the profit and loss diagram for a protective put has a shape similar to a long call position, 
which is the result of put–call parity. Long the asset and long the put is equivalent to long a call plus long 
a risk-free bond.

EXAMPLE 4
Characteristics of Protective Puts
S0 = Stock price when option position opened = 25.00
X = Option exercise price = 20.00
ST= Stock price at option expiration = 31.33
p0 = Put premium paid = 1.15
1. Which of the following correctly calculates the gain with the protective put?
A. ST − S0 − p0 = 31.33 − 25.00 − 1.15 = 5.18
B. ST − S0 + p0 = 31.33 − 25.00 + 1.15 = 7.48
C. ST − X − p0 = 31.33 − 20.00 − 1.15 = 10.18
Solution:
A is correct. If the stock price is above the put exercise price at expiration, 
the put will expire worthless. The profit is the gain on the stock (ST − S0) 
minus the cost of the put. Note that the maximum profit with a protective 
put is theoretically unlimited, because the stock can rise to any level and the 
entire profit is earned by the stockholder.
2. Which of the following correctly calculates the breakeven stock price with 
the protective put?
A. S0 − p0 = 25.00 − 1.15 = 23.85
B. S0 + p0 = 25.00 + 1.15 = 26.15
C. ST + p0 = 31.33 + 1.15 = 32.48
Solution:
B is correct. Because the option buyer pays the put premium, she does not 
begin to make money until the stock rises by enough to recover the premi -
um paid.
3. Which of the following correctly calculates the maximum loss with the pro -
tective put?
A. S0 − X + p0 = 25.00 − 20.00 + 1.15 = 6.15
B. ST − X − p0 = 31.33 − 20.00 − 1.15 = 10.18
C. S0 − p0 = 25.00 − 1.15 = 23.85
Solution:
A is correct. Once the stock falls to the put exercise price, further losses are 
eliminated. The investor paid the option premium, so the total loss is the 
“deductible” plus the cost of the insurance.
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 24
EQUIVALENCE TO LONG ASSET/SHORT FORWARD 
POSITION
compare the delta of covered call and protective put positions 
with the position of being long an asset and short a forward on the 
underlying asset
All investors who consider option strategies should understand that some options are 
more sensitive to changes in the underlying asset than others. As we have seen, this 
relationship is measured by delta, an indispensable tool to an options user. Because a 
long call increases in value and a long put decreases in value as the underlying asset 
increases in price, call deltas range from 0 to 1 and put deltas range from 0 to −1. 
(Naturally, the signs are reversed for short positions in these options.) A long position 
in the underlying asset has a delta of 1.0, whereas a short position has a delta of −1.0. 
When the share price is close to the strike price, a rough approximation is that a long 
ATM option will have a delta that is approximately 0.5 (for a call) or −0.5 (for a put). 
Exhibit 12  shows the delta for the PBR SEP 16 put and call versus share price. As the 
stock price moves toward 16 (the strike price), the call option delta is approximately 
0.52 and the put delta is −0.48. In general, Call Delta − Put Delta = 1 for options on 
the same underlying with the same BSM model inputs.

PBR Stock PriceCall Delta
Put Delta
Delta can be applied to a portfolio as well. Suppose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, 
Honda Motor Company stock sells for ¥3,500. A portfolio contains 100 shares, and 
the manager writes one exchange-traded covered call contract with a ¥3,500 strike. 
The delta of the 100-share position will be 100 × +1 = +100. Because the call is at the 
money, meaning that the stock price and exercise price are equal, it will have a delta 
of approximately 0.5. The portfolio, however, is short one call contract. From the 
perspective of the portfolio, the delta of the short call contract is −0.5 × 100 = −50. A 
short call loses  money as the underlying price rises. So, this covered call has a position 
delta  (which is an overall or portfolio delta) of 50, consisting of +100 points for the 
stock and −50 points for the short call. Compare this call with a protective put, in 
which someone buys 100 shares of stock and one contract of an ATM put. Its position 
delta would also be 50: +100 points for the stock and −50 points for the long put.
Finally, consider a long stock position of 100 shares and a short forward position 
of 50 shares. Because futures and forwards on non-dividend-paying stocks are essen -
tially proxies for the stock, their deltas are also 1.0 for a long position and −1.0 for 
a short position. In this example, the short forward position “cancels” half the long 5
Equivalence to Long Asset/Short Forward Position 25
stock position, so the position delta is also 50. These examples show three different 
positions: an ATM covered call, an ATM protective put, and a long stock/short for -
ward position that all have the same delta. For small movements in the price of the 
underlying asset, these positions will show very similar gains and losses.
Writing Puts
If someone writes a put option and simultaneously deposits an amount of money equal 
to the exercise price into a designated account, it is called writing a cash-secured 
put.13 This strategy is appropriate for someone who is bullish on a stock or who 
wants to acquire shares at a particular price. The fact that the option exercise price 
is escrowed provides assurance that the put writer will be able to purchase the stock 
if the option holder chooses to exercise. Think of the cash in a cash-secured put as 
being similar to the stock part of a covered call. When an investor sells a covered call, 
she takes on the obligation to sell a stock, and this obligation is covered by ownership 
in the shares. When a put option is sold to create a new position, the obligation that 
accompanies this position is to purchase shares. In order to cover the obligation to 
purchase shares, the portfolio should have enough cash in the account to make good 
on this obligation. The short put position is covered or secured by cash in the account.
Now consider two slightly different scenarios using the price data from Exhibit 
6. In the first scenario, one investor might be bullish on PBR and is interested in 
buying the stock at a cheaper price. With the stock at 15.84, she writes the SEP 15 
put for 0.65, which is purchased by another investor who is bearish on PBR stock. 
The option writer will keep the option premium regardless of what the stock price 
does. If the stock is below 15 at expiration, however, the put would be exercised and 
the option writer would be obliged to purchase shares from the option holder at the 
exercise price of 15.
Possible small (and independent) changes to the variables from Exhibit 6  are sim -
ulated in Exhibit 13  for the long PBR SEP 15 put position. The long put is illustrated 
here for simplicity—these statistics for the long put position should also help the put 
writer to understand the risks and returns for her position, because a short position 
is simply the mirror image of the long position. The initial values are 15.84 for the 
stock and 0.65 for the put, and the put buyer has acquired a delta of −0.335 and a 
gamma of 0.136.14
As demonstrated in change #1, if the stock price rises by 0.10 from 15.84 to 15.94, 
the long (short) put will lose (gain) approximately −0.335 × 0.10 = −0.0335 (+0.0335), 
as the put value drops from 0.65 to approximately 0.617 (≈ 0.6165 = 0.65 − 0.0335). 
Remember, this approximation is good for only a small change in the underlying share 
price. As the stock price rises, the long put’s initial delta, −0.335, will change at a rate 
of gamma, 0.136, so the delta then becomes −0.321.
13 This strategy is also called a fiduciary put . Note that for a European option, the amount deposited 
would equal the present value of the exercise price. When someone writes a put but does not escrow the 
exercise price, it is sometimes called a nakedput . Note that this is a slightly different use of the adjective 
“naked” than with a naked call. When writing a naked call, the call writer does not have the underlying 
asset  to deliver if the call is exercised. When an investor writes a naked put, he has not set aside the cash  
necessary to buy the asset if the put is exercised.
14 The put writer (short position) will have a delta of −(−0.335) = +0.335.

The long SEP 15 put position also has a theta of −0.015 and a vega of +0.017.15 As 
time decays, the long (short) put option will lose (gain) value at a rate of theta, so 
the value of long (short) position will decrease (increase) by approximately 0.015/per 
day. As demonstrated in change #2 (which is separate and independent from change 
#1), all else equal, the long put value would drop from about 0.65 to 0.635 as the put 
moves one day closer to expiration (from 30 to 29 days). If the implied volatility of the 
SEP 15 put were to increase by 1% (from 58.44% to 59.44%), all else equal, the option 
price would increase by 0.017 to approximately 0.667, as demonstrated in change #3. 
The increase in volatility would benefit the put holder at the expense of the writer, 
because the short put position would lose 0.017.
If the stock is above 15 at expiration, the put option will expire unexercised. At the 
expiration date, the put writer will either keep the premium or have PBR shares put 
to her at 15. Because the put writer was bullish on PBR and wanted to purchase it at 
a cheaper price, she may be happy with this result. Netting out the option premium 
received by the put writer would make her effective purchase price 15.00 − 0.65 = 14.35.
In another scenario, an institutional investor might be interested in purchasing 
PBR. Suppose the investor wrote the SEP 17 put for 1.76. This strategy will have slightly 
different values for the Greeks compared with the previous strategy. The delta of the 
SEP 17 short put position will be +0.62, gamma will be −0.140, and theta will equal 
+0.016. This position will be more sensitive to changes in the stock price than the 
SEP 15 put. If the PBR share price increases 0.10 from 15.84 to 15.94, the put writer 
will now profit by approximately +0.62 × 0.10 = 0.062. The higher strike price makes 
the short SEP 17 put a more bullish position than the SEP 15 put. This dynamic is 
reflected in the larger delta for the short SEP 17 put at +0.620 (versus +0.335 for the 
short SEP 15 put).
If the stock is below 17 at expiration, the SEP 17 puts will be exercised and the 
investor (i.e., put writer) will pay 17 for the shares, resulting in a net price of 17.00 
− 1.76 = 15.24. Anytime someone writes an option, the maximum gain is the option 
premium received, so in this case, the maximum gain is 1.76. The maximum loss 
15 All else equal, a long put loses time value as it approaches expiration (negative theta). All else equal, 
a long put increases in value as the volatility is increased (positive vega). In the case of a short put, the 
signs are reversed.
Risk Reduction Using Covered Calls and Protective Puts 27
when writing a put occurs when the stock falls to zero. The option writer pays the 
exercise price for worthless stock but still keeps the premium. In this example, the 
maximum loss would be 17.00 − 1.76 = 15.24. Exhibit 14  shows the corresponding 
profit and loss diagram.

Note the similar shape of the covered call position in Exhibit 9  and the short put in 
Exhibit 14 . Writing a covered call and writing a put are very similar with regard to 
their risk and reward characteristics.16
RISK REDUCTION USING COVERED CALLS AND 
PROTECTIVE PUTS
compare the effect of buying a call on a short underlying position 
with the effect of selling a put on a short underlying position
Covered calls and protective puts may both be viewed as risk-reducing or hedging 
strategies. In the case of a covered call, some price uncertainty is eliminated for price 
increases. For a protective put, the price uncertainty is eliminated for price decreases. 
The risk reduction can be understood by considering hedge statistics.
Covered Calls
Consider the individual who owns 100 shares of a PBR stock at 15.84. The long position 
has a delta of +100. Suppose the investor now writes a NOV 17 call contract against 
this entire position. These options have a delta of 0.475. This covered call position 
has a position delta of (100 × +1.0) − (100 × 0.475) = +52.5. A position delta of 52.5 
is equivalent (for small changes) to owning 52.5 shares of the underlying asset. An 
16 The two strategies are very similar due to put–call parity. Recall that P = C − S + PV of X, implying that 
−P ≈ −C + S (ignoring PV of X), thus showing that a short put payoff profile is similar to that of a covered call.6
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 28
investor can lose more money on a 100-share position than on a 52.5-share position. 
Even if the stock declines to nearly zero, the loss is reduced only by the amount of 
the option premium received. Viewed this way, the covered call position is less risky 
than the underlying asset held alone. The lower position delta will work against the 
investor if the share price increases. A PBR share price above 17 would result in the 
shares getting called away, and portfolio gains per share are limited to 2.60 = ( X − S0) 
+ c0 = (17 − 15.84) + 1.44.
Protective Puts
Similar logic applies to the use of protective puts. An investor who buys a put is essen -
tially buying insurance on the stock. An investor owning PBR stock could purchase 
a NOV 15 put with an option delta of −0.359. The position delta from 100 shares of 
PBR stock and one NOV 15 put contract would be +100 + (−0.359 × 100) = +64.1 For 
small changes in price, the protective put portfolio reduces the risk of the 100-share 
PBR position to the equivalent of a 64.1 share position. This insurance lasts only until 
NOV. One buys insurance to protect against a risk, and the policyholder should not 
feel bad if the risk event does not materialize and he does not get to use the insurance. 
Stated another way, a homeowner should be happy if the fire insurance on his house 
goes unused. Still, we do not want to buy insurance we do not need, especially if it is 
expensive. Continually purchasing puts to protect against a possible stock price decline 
will result in lower volatility in the overall portfolio, but the trade-off between premium 
cost and risk reduction must be carefully considered. Such continuous purchasing 
of puts to protect against a possible stock price decline is an expensive strategy that 
would wipe out most of the long-term gain on an otherwise good investment. The 
occasional purchase of a protective put to manage a temporary situation, however, 
can be a sensible risk-reducing activity.
Buying Calls and Writing Puts on a Short Position
The discussion on protective puts (Stock + Put) and covered calls (Stock − Call) 
describes risk-reduction strategies for investors with long positions in the underlying 
asset. How can investors reduce risk when they are short the underlying asset? The 
short investor is worried the underlying stock will go up and profits if the underlying 
stock goes down. To offset the risks of a short position, an investor may purchase a 
call. The new portfolio will be (Call − Stock). The long call will offset portfolio losses 
when the share price increases.
To generate income from option premiums, the investor may also sell a put. As 
the stock drops in value, the investor profits from the short stock position, but the 
portfolio (− Put − Stock) gains will be reduced by the short put. When the share 
price increases, the short position loses money. The put expires worthless, meaning 
the investor will keep the put premium. The loss on the short position can still be 
substantial but is somewhat reduced by the put option premium.
Let us consider these two scenarios using the price data from Exhibit 6 . In both 
cases, the investor is bearish on PBR and shorts the stock at 15.84. In the first case, she 
purchases the SEP 16 call for 0.97. As the share price increases above 16, the payoff  
from the call will act to offset losses in the short position. Exhibit 15  illustrates this 
dynamic. As the share price increases, portfolio losses never exceed 1.13. The profit on 
the short stock position plus the profit from the in-the-money call equals (15.84 − S) 
+ [(S − 16) − 0.97] = −1.13. If the share price decreases, the investor profits from the 
short but loses the call premium of 0.97. The delta from the short PBR shares is −1. 
The SEP 16 call delta is 0.516. The overall portfolio delta is still negative at −0.484, 
making this a bearish strategy. The investor is also long vega from purchasing the call, 
Risk Reduction Using Covered Calls and Protective Puts 29
0.018, and the position is exposed to time decay, because theta is −0.018 per day. So, 
she is hoping to profit from increased downside volatility from the short PBR shares 
while the long call cushions losses from increased upside volatility.

PBR Shar e Price at SEP  Expiration
In the second scenario, the investor writes the SEP 15 put for 0.65 and collects the put 
premium. The upside protection from the long call in the first scenario is not provided 
by writing a put. The short stock position can have potentially unlimited losses. As 
shown in Exhibit 16 , the potential gain from a falling PBR price now belongs to the put 
owner. The maximum gain from this strategy is given by the profit on the short stock 
position plus the profit from the out-of-the-money short put, which equals (15.84 − 
S) − [(15 − S) − 0.65] = 1.49. Losses from the short stock position will be cushioned 
only by the 0.65 premium collected from writing the put. The delta of the short PBR 
shares is −1, and the delta of the short put is − (−0.335), so the position delta is −1 + 
0.335 = −0.665. The investor is bearish and hoping to profit from a downward price 
move. She is also short vega from writing the put, (−0.017), and benefits from time 
decay, as theta of the short put is +0.015 (= − [−0.015]). So, she is hoping for reduced 
volatility to give her an opportunity to collect the put premium without losing from 
the short on PBR shares.

Risk-Reduction Strategies
Janet Reiter is a US-based investor who holds a limited partnership investment 
in a French private equity firm. She has received notice from the firm’s general 
partner of an upcoming capital call. Reiter plans to purchase €1,000,000 in 
three months to meet the capital call due at that time. The current exchange 
rate is US$1.20/€1, but Reiter is concerned the euro will strengthen against the 
US dollar. She considers the following instruments to reduce the risk of the 
planned purchase:
 ■A three-month USD/EUR call option (to buy euros) with a strike rate 
X = US$1.25/€1 and costing US$0.02/€1
 ■A three-month EUR/USD put option (to sell dollars) with a strike rate 
X = €0.8080/US$1 priced at €0.0134/US$1
 ■A three-month USD/EUR futures contract (to buy euros) with f0 = 
US$1.2052/€1

planned purchase.

Reiter could purchase a €1,000,000 call option struck at US$1.25/€1 for 
US$20,000. If the EUR price were to increase above US$1.25, she would ex -
ercise her right to buy EUR for US$1.25. She would also benefit from being 
able to purchase EUR at a cheaper price should the exchange rate weaken. A 
call on the euro is like a put on the US dollar. So, a put to sell dollars struck 
at an exchange rate of X = €0.8000/US$1 can be viewed as a call to buy Euro 
at an exchange rate of US$1/€0.8000 = US$1.25/€1. Reiter could also buy 
a put option on USD struck at X = €0.8080/US$1 which would allow her 
to sell US$1,237,624 (= €1,000,000/[€0.8080/$1]) to receive the €1,000,000 
should the dollar weaken below that level. This would cost her €0.0134/
Spreads and Combinations 31
US$1 × US$1,237,624 = €16,584 or US$19,901 upfront. If USD appreciated 
against the EUR, Reiter would still be able to benefit from the lower cost to 
purchase the EUR. She could instead enter a long position in a three-month 
futures contract at US$1.2052. Reiter would have the obligation to purchase 
€1,000,000 at US$1.2052 regardless of the exchange rate in three months. 
The futures position requires a margin deposit, but no premium is paid.
2. Reiter purchases call options for US$20,000, and the exchange rate increases 
to US$1.29/€1 (EUR currency strengthens) over the next three months. The 
effective price Reiter pays for her 1,000,000 EUR purchase is closest to:
A. US$1,270,000.
B. US$1,290,000.
C. US$1,310,000.
Solution:
A is correct. At an exchange rate of US$1.29/€1, the call with strike of X 
= US$1.25/€1 will be exercised. Including the call premium (US$0.02/€1), 
the price effectively paid for the euros is US$1.27/€1 × €1,000,000 = 
US$1,270,000.
3. Calculate the price Reiter will pay for the EUR using the three instruments 
if the exchange rate in three months falls to US$1.10/€1 (EUR currency 
weakens).
Solution:
Both the call and the put options will expire unexercised and Reiter benefits 
from the lower rate by purchasing €1,000,000 for US$1,100,000. However, 
she will lose the premiums she paid for the options. For the futures contract, 
she pays US$1.2052/€1 or US$1,205,200 for €1,000,000 regardless of the 
more favorable rate.
SPREADS AND COMBINATIONS
discuss the investment objective(s), structure, payoffs, risk(s), value 
at expiration, profit, maximum profit, maximum loss, and breakeven 
underlying price at expiration of the following option strategies: bull 
spread, bear spread, straddle, and collar
Option spreads and combinations can be useful option strategies. We first consider 
money spreads, in which the two options differ only by exercise price. The investor 
buys an option with a given expiration and exercise price and sells an option with 
the same expiration but a different exercise price. Of course, the options are on the 
same underlying asset. The term spread  is used here because the payoff is based on 
the difference, or spread, between option exercise prices. For a bull or bear spread, the 
investor buys one call and writes another call option with a different exercise price, 7
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 32
or the investor buys one put and writes another put with a different exercise price.17 
Someone might, for instance, buy a NOV 16 call and simultaneously write a NOV 17 
call, or one might buy a SEP 17 put and write a SEP 15 put. An option combination 
typically uses both puts and calls. The most important option combination is the 
straddle, on which we focus in this reading. We will investigate spreads first.
Bull Spreads and Bear Spreads
Spreads are classified in two ways: by market sentiment and by the direction of 
the initial cash flows. A spread that becomes more valuable when the price of the 
underlying asset rises is a bull spread ; a spread that becomes more valuable when 
the price of the underlying asset declines is a bear spread . Because the investor buys 
one option and sells another, there is typically an initial net cash outflow or inflow. If 
establishing the spread requires a cash payment by the investor, it is referred to as a 
debit spread. Debit spreads are effectively long because the long option value exceeds 
the short option value. If the spread initially results in a cash inflow to the investor, 
it is referred to as a credit spread. Credit spreads18 are effectively short because the 
short option value exceeds the long option value. Any of these strategies can be cre -
ated with puts or calls. The motivation for a spread is usually to place a directional 
bet, giving up part of the profit potential in exchange for a lower cost of the position. 
Some examples will help make this clear.
Bull Spread
Regardless of whether someone constructs a bull spread with puts or with calls, the 
strategy requires buying one option and writing another with a higher  exercise price. 
Because the higher exercise price call is less expensive than the lower strike, a call bull 
spread involves an initial cash outflow (debit spread). A bull spread created from puts 
also requires the investor to write the higher-strike option and buy the lower-strike 
one. Because the higher-strike put is more expensive, a put bull spread involves an 
initial cash inflow (credit spread).
Let’s consider a call bull spread. Suppose, for instance, an investor thought it 
likely that by the September option expiration, PBR would rise to around 17 from 
its current level of 15.84. Based on the price data in Exhibit 6 , what option strategy 
would capitalize on this anticipated price movement? If he were to buy the SEP 15 
call for 1.64 and the stock rose to 17 at expiration, the call would be worth ST − X = 
17 − 15 = 2. If the price of the option was 1.64, the profit is 0.36. The maximum loss 
is the price paid for the option, or 1.64. If, instead, an investor bought the SEP 16 call 
for 0.97, at an expiration stock price of 17, the call would be worth 1.00 for a gain of 
0.03. A spread could make more sense with the following option values. If he believes 
the stock will not rise above 17 by September expiration, it may make sense to “sell 
off” the part of the return distribution above that price. The investor would receive 
0.51 for each SEP 17 call sold.
The value of the spread at expiration ( VT) depends on the stock price at expiration 
ST. For a bull spread, the investor buys the low strike option (struck at XL) and sells 
the high strike option (struck at XH), so that:
 VT = Max(0, ST − XL) − Max(0, ST − XH). (5)
17 One important exception to the typical option spread is a butterfly spread , which is essentially two 
simultaneous spreads and can be done using only calls or only puts.
18 The use of the term credit spread has a different interpretation than in fixed income investing. For bond 
investors, the credit spread is a measure of compensation for the bond’s default risk.
Spreads and Combinations 33
Therefore, the value depends on the terminal stock price ST:
 VT = 0 − 0 = 0    if ST ≤ XL
 VT = ST − XL − 0 = ST − XL  if XL < ST < XH
 VT = ST − XL− (ST − XH) = XH − XL if ST ≥ XH
The profit is obtained by subtracting the initial outlay for the spread from the 
foregoing value of the spread at expiration. To determine the initial outlay, recall that 
a call option with a lower exercise price will be more expensive than a call option with 
a higher exercise price. Because we are buying the call with the lower exercise price 
(for cL) and selling the call with the higher exercise price (for cH), the call we buy will 
cost more than the call we sell ( cL > cH). Hence, the spread will require a net outlay 
of funds. This net outlay is the initial value of the position, V0 = cL − cH, which we 
call the net premium. The profit is:
 Π = Max(0, ST − XL) − Max(0, ST − XH) − (cL − cH). (6)
In this manner, we see that the profit is the profit from the long call, Max(0, ST − 
XL) − cL, plus the profit from the short call, −Max(0, ST − XH) + cH. Broken down into 
ranges, the profit is as follows:
 Π = − cL + cH if ST ≤ XL
 Π = ST − XL − cL + cH if XL < ST < XH
 Π = XH − XL − cL + cH if ST ≥ XH
If ST is below XL, the strategy will lose a limited amount of money. When both options 
expire out of the money, the investor loses the net premium, cL − cH. The profit on 
the upside, if ST is at least XH, is also limited to the difference in strike prices minus 
the net premium.
Consider two alternatives for the call purchase leg of the bull spread: 1) buy the 
SEP 15 call or 2) buy the SEP 16 call instead. Which is preferred? With Alternative 
1, the SEP 15 call costs 1.64. Writing the SEP 17 call brings in 0.51, so the net cost is 
1.64 − 0.51 = 1.13. Traders would refer to this position as a PBR SEP 15/17 bull call 
spread. The maximum profit would occur at or above the exercise price of 17 because 
all gains above this level belong to the owner of the PBR SEP 17 call. At an underlying 
price of 17 or higher, from the trader’s perspective, the position is worth 2, which 
represents the price appreciation from 15 to 17 (i.e., the difference in strikes). The 
maximum profit is
 Π  =  XH − XL − cL + cH = 17 − 15 − 1.64 + 0.51 = 0.87.
Another way to look at it is that at a price above 17, the trader exercises the long call, 
buying the stock at 15, and is forced to sell the stock at 17 to the holder of his short call.
With Alternative 2, the investor buys the SEP 16 call and pays 0.97 for it. Writing 
the SEP 17 call brings in 0.51, so the net cost would be 0.97 − 0.51 = 0.46. At an under -
lying price of 17 or higher, the spread would be worth 1.00, so the maximum profit is
 Π  =  XH − XL − cL + cH = 17 − 16 − 0.97 + 0.51 = 0.54.
Exhibit 17  compares the profit and loss diagrams for these two alternatives.
To determine the breakeven price with a spread, find the underlying asset price 
that will cause the exercise value of the two options combined to equal the initial cost 
of the spread. A spread has two exercise prices. There are also two option premiums. 
Mathematically, the breakeven price for a call bull spread can be derived from Π = 
ST* − XL − cL + cH = 0 and is
 ST* = XL + cL − cH,
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 34
which represents the lower exercise price plus the cost of the spread. In the examples 
here, Alternative 1 costs 1.13 (= 1.64 − 0.51). The breakeven ST* = XL + cL − cH = 15 
+ 1.64 − 0.51 = 16.13. If at option expiration the stock is 16.13, the 15-strike option 
would be worth 1.13 and the 17-strike call would be worthless. The breakeven price 
ST* is 15.00 + 1.13 = 16.13, as Exhibit 17  shows.

Alternative 2:
Maximum Pr ofit = 0.54
MaximumLoss = 0.46
Breakeven = 16.46
Which of the alternatives is preferable? There is no clear-cut answer. As Exhibit 17  
shows, the maximum loss for alternative 1 is 1.64 − 0.51= 1.13, compared with a max -
imum loss of 0.97 − 0.51 = 0.46 for Alternative 2. However, Alternative 1 is potentially 
more profitable for a move above 17 and has a lower breakeven price.
With Alternative 1, the breakeven point of 16.13 is less than 2% above the current 
level of 15.84, whereas with Alternative 2, reaching the breakeven point requires 
almost a 4% rise in the stock price. There is some additional information in Exhibit 6  
the investor may wish to consider. The SEP 15/17 spread involves buying the SEP15 
call with implied volatility of 64.42% and selling the SEP 17 call option with implied 
volatility of 51.07%. The investor may believe the SEP 15 call being purchased is 
relatively expensive compared with the SEP 17 call being sold. The PBR SEP 16/17 
involves buying a SEP 16 call at a cost of 0.97 with an implied volatility of 55.92%. 
The investor may believe the SEP 16 call represents a better value than the SEP 15 
call and so may choose the PBR SEP 16/17 spread.
We can calculate the Greek values for the spread. For example, using Exhibit 6 , we 
see the theta of the PBR SEP 15/17 spread is −0.004 = −0.019 − (−0.015), and the theta 
of the PBR SEP 16/17 is −0.003 = −0.018 − (−0.015). Therefore, the SEP 16/17 should 
experience slightly less erosion of value resulting from time decay. The investor may 
also consider the delta and gamma that each spread would add to her PBR position. 
The delta of the PBR SEP 15/17 spread is +0.306 = 0.657 − 0.351, and the delta of the 
PBR SEP 16/17 spread is +0.165 = 0.516 − 0.351. From the current PBR price of 15.84, 
the long position in the PBR 15 call will make the SEP 15/17 PBR spread slightly more 
sensitive to an increase in share price than the SEP 16/17 spread. For the SEP 15/17, 
we have gamma = −0.034 = 0.125 − 0.159 and for the SEP 16/17 gamma = −0.003 = 
0.156 − 0.159. The more negative gamma value for the SEP 15/17 spread means that 
Spreads and Combinations 35
the position delta will decrease at a faster rate than the SEP 16/17 spread as the price 
of PBR shares increase. By carefully selecting the expiration and exercise prices for the 
options for the spread, an investor can choose the risk–return mix that most closely 
matches her investment outlook.
Bear Spread
With a bull spread, the investor buys the lower exercise price and writes the higher 
exercise price. It is the opposite with a bear spread: buy the higher exercise price 
and sell the lower. Because puts with higher exercise prices are (all else equal) more 
expensive, a put bear spread will result in an initial cash outflow (be a debit spread). 
For a call bear spread, the investor buys a higher exercise price call and sells the 
lower exercise price call. Because the higher exercise price call being purchased is less 
expensive than the lower strike being sold, a call bear spread will result in an initial 
cash inflow (credit spread).
If a trader believed PBR stock would be below 15 by the November expiration, 
one strategy would be to buy the PBR NOV 16 put at 1.96 and write the NOV 15 put 
at 1.46. This spread has a net cost of 0.50; this amount is the maximum loss, and it 
occurs at a PBR stock price of 16 or higher. The maximum gain is also 0.50, which 
occurs at a stock price of 15 or lower. (A useful way to see this result is to realize that 
reversing the signs of the trades leaves the horizontal axes in a diagram like Exhibit 17  
intact, but it flips the profit/loss and cost lines vertically! A debit from buying a spread 
must be consistent with the seller of the same spread receiving a credit.) Finding the 
breakeven price uses the same logic as with a bull spread: find the underlying asset 
price at which the exercise value equals the initial cost. Let pL represent the lower-strike 
put premium and pH the higher-strike put premium. Mathematically, the value of this 
bear spread position at expiration is:
 VT = Max(0, XH − ST) − Max(0, XL − ST). (7)
Broken down into ranges, we have the following relations:
 VT = XH − ST − (XL − ST) = XH − XL if ST ≤ XL
 VT = XH − ST − 0 = XH − ST  if XL < ST < XH
 VT = 0 − 0 = 0    if ST ≥ XH
To obtain the profit, we subtract the initial outlay. Because we are buying the put 
with the higher exercise price and selling the put with the lower exercise price, the 
put we are buying is more expensive than the put we are selling. The initial value of 
the bear spread is V0 = pH − pL. The profit is, therefore, VT − V0, which is:
 Π = Max(0, XH − ST) − Max(0, XL − ST) − (pH − pL). (8)
We see that the profit is that on the long put, Max(0, XH − ST) − pH, plus the profit 
from the short put, −Max(0, XL − ST) + pL. Broken down into ranges, the profit is as 
follows:
 Π = XH − XL − pH + pL  if ST ≤ XL
 Π = XH − ST − pH + pL  if XL < ST < XH
 Π = − pH + pL   if ST ≥ XH
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 36
The breakeven point, ST* = XH − pH + pL, sets the profit equal to zero between 
the strike prices. In this example, 16 − 1.96 + 1.46 = 15.50. That is, at a stock price of 
15.50 on the expiration day, the 16-strike put would be worth 0.50 and the 15-strike 
put would be worthless. Exhibit 18  shows the profit and loss for a NOV 15/16 bear

Refining Spreads
It is not necessary that both legs of a spread be established at the same time or main -
tained for the same period. Options are very versatile, and positions can typically be 
quickly adjusted as market conditions change. Here are a few examples of different 
tactical adjustments an option trader might consider.
Adding a Short Leg to a Long Position
Consider Carlos Aguila, a trader who in September paid a premium of 1.50 for a NOV 
40 call when the underlying stock was selling for 37. A month later, in October, the 
stock has risen to 48. He observes the following premiums for one-month call options.
Strike Premium
40 8.30
45 4.42
50 1.91
19 Bull spreads can also be created with puts, and bear spreads can also be created with calls. In both 
cases, the result is a credit spread with an initial cash inflow. Recall that American exercise–style options 
may be exercised at any time prior to expiration. Bull spreads with American puts have an additional risk, 
which is that the short put could be exercised early when the long put is not yet in the money. If the bull 
spread uses American calls and the short call is exercised, the long call is deeper in the money, which 
offsets that risk. A similar point can be applied to bear spreads using calls. Bear spreads with American 
calls have increased risk, because the short call may be exercised early when the long call may not yet be in 
the money. Thus, with American options, bull spreads with calls and bear spreads with puts are generally 
preferred but, of course, not required.
Spreads and Combinations 37
This position has become very profitable. The call he bought is now worth 8.30. He 
paid 1.50, so his profit at this point is 8.30 − 1.50 = 6.80. He thinks the stock is likely 
to stabilize around its new level and doubts that it will go much higher. Aguila is 
considering writing a call option with an exercise price of either 45 or 50, thereby 
converting his long call position into a bull spread. Looking first at the NOV 50 call, 
he notes that the 1.91 premium would more than cover the initial cost of the NOV 
40 call. If he were to write this call, the new profit and loss diagram would look like 
Exhibit 19 . To review, consider the following points:
 ■At stock prices of 50 or higher, the exercise value of the spread is 10.00. The 
reason is because both options would be in the money, and a call with an 
exercise price of 40 would always be worth 10 more at exercise than a call 
with an exercise price of 50. The initial cost of the call with an exercise price 
of 40 was 1.50, and there would be a 1.91 cash inflow after writing the call 
with an exercise price of 50. The profit is 10.00 − 1.50 + 1.91 = 10.41.
 ■At stock prices of 40 or lower, the exercise value of the spread is zero; both 
options would be out of the money. The initial cost of the call with an exer -
cise price of 40 was 1.50, and there would be a 1.91 cash inflow after writing 
the call with an exercise price of 50. The profit is 0 − 1.50 + 1.91 = 0.41.
 ■Between the two strike prices (40 and 50), the exercise value of the spread 
rises steadily as the stock price increases. For every unit increase up to the 
higher strike price, the exercise value of this spread increases by 1.0.
For instance, if the stock price remains unchanged at 48, the exercise value of the 
spread is 8.00. The reason is because the call with an exercise price of 40 would be 
worth 8.00 and the call with an exercise price of 50 would be worthless. The initial 
cost of the 40-strike call was 1.50, and there would be a 1.91 cash inflow when the 
50-strike call was written. The profit is 8.00 − 1.50 + 1.91 = 8.41.
Now assume that he has written the NOV 50 call. Aguila needs to be careful how 
he views this new situation. No matter what happens to the stock price between now 
and expiration, the position is profitable, relative to his purchase price of the calls with 
an exercise price of 40. If the stock were to fall by any amount from its current level, 
however, he would have an opportunity loss. His profit would decrease progressively 
if the price trended back to 40. Aguila would be correct in saying that the bull spread 
will make a profit of at least 0.41. But, writing the NOV 50 call only partially hedges 
against a decline in the value of his new strategy. The position can still lose about 96% 
of its maximum profit, because only about 4% (0.41/10.41) has been hedged.

Spreads and Delta
A spread strategy may be adapted to a changing market view. Suppose the market 
has been rising, and Lars Clive, an options trader, expects this trend to continue. 
Hypothetical company ZKQ currently sells for $44. Suppose Clive buys a NOV 45 call 
for 5.25. He computes the delta of this call as +0.55 and gamma as +0.028. Initially, 
Clive will profit at a rate of 0.55 for an increase of $1 in the price of ZKQ stock. For 
small changes, the delta of his position will increase at a rate of 0.028 for an increase 
of $1 in the price of ZKQ shares.
Three days later, the stock price has risen to $49, the value of the NOV 45 call has 
increased to 8.18, and the call delta has increased to +0.68. For the NOV 45 call, the 
option price increased by 2.93 (= 8.18 − 5.25) instead of by 2.75 (= 5 × 0.55, the stock 
price change multiplied by the initial delta value). Because delta is changing at a rate 
gamma, the approximation works best for small changes in share prices. With the stock 
at $49, a higher-strike NOV 50 call sells for 5.74 and has a delta of +0.55. Now Clive 
establishes a 45/50 bull call spread by writing the NOV 50 call. Clive is less bullish at 
the price of 49, and his 45/50 spread portfolio now has a delta of +0.13 = +0.68 − 0.55.
Now suppose another five days pass and the stock price falls to 45. The new option 
values would be 5.41 for the NOV 45 call and 3.55 for the NOV 50 call. Clive closes 
out the NOV 50 short call by buying it back. He sold the call for 5.74 and bought it 
back for 3.55, so he makes 5.74 − 3.55 = 2.19, or 2.19 per contract. He still holds the 
long position in the NOV 45 call, and his portfolio delta increases to +0.57.
Another four days pass, and ZKQ has risen to 48. The new price for the NOV 
50 call is 4.71 with a delta of 0.51. Clive owns the NOV 45 with a price of 7.10 and a 
delta of 0.66. He then decides to write a NOV 50 call and lower his position delta to 
0.15 (= 0.66 − 0.51).
At this point, Clive has had two cash outflows totaling 8.80: the initial 5.25 plus 
the 3.55 to buy back the NOV 50 call. He has two cash inflows totaling 10.45: the 
premium income of 5.74 and then 4.71 from the two instances of writing the NOV 
50 calls. Exhibit 20  provides a summary of the results of Clive’s trades. Because the 
inflows of 10.45 exceed the outflows of 8.80, he has a resulting profit and loss diagram 
similar to the plot in Exhibit 19  that we saw in the previous example. Clive’s timing 
was excellent—in each case, he increased his portfolio delta prior to an increase in 
Spreads and Combinations 39
ZKQ stock and decreased delta before the share price decreased. The important 
point is that increasing portfolio delta will result in greater profits (losses) when the 
underlying asset value increases (decreases).

Spreads are primarily a directional play on the underlying asset’s spot price (and also 
potentially on its volatility); still, spread traders can attempt to take advantage of 
changes in price, and it is easy to create a hypothetical example like this one. There 
obviously is no guarantee that any assumed price trend will continue. In fact, in 
actual practice, the excellent results shown in Exhibit 20  are exceedingly difficult to 
achieve. Still, the experienced option user knows to look for opportunistic plays that 
arise from price swings.

Use the following information to answer questions 1 to 3 on spreads.
 S0 = 44.50
 OCT 45 call = 2.55, OCT 45 put = 2.92
 OCT 50 call = 1.45, OCT 50 put = 6.80
1. What is the maximum gain with an OCT 45/50 bull call spread?
A. 1.10
B. 3.05
C. 3.90
Solution:
C is correct. With a bull spread, the maximum gain occurs at the high 
exercise price. At an underlying price of 50 or higher, the spread is worth 
the difference in the strike prices, or 50 − 45 = 5. The cost of establishing the 
spread is the price paid for the lower-strike option minus the price received 
for the higher-strike option: 2.55 − 1.45 = 1.10. The maximum gain is 5.00 − 
1.10 = 3.90.
2. What is the maximum loss with an OCT 45/50 bear put spread?
A. 1.12
B. 3.88
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 40
C. 4.38
Solution:
B is correct. With a bear spread, an investor buys the higher exercise price 
and writes the lower exercise price. When this strategy is done with puts, 
the higher exercise price option costs more than the lower exercise price op -
tion. Thus, the investor has a debit spread with an initial cash outlay, which 
is the most he can lose. The initial cash outlay is the cost of the OCT 50 put 
minus the premium received from writing the OCT 45 put: 6.80 − 2.92 = 
3.88.
3. What is the breakeven price with an OCT 45/50 bull call spread?
A. 46.10
B. 47.50
C. 48.88
Solution:
A is correct. An investor buys the OCT 45 call for 2.55 and sells the OCT 
50 call for 1.45, for a net cost of 1.10. She breaks even when the position is 
worth the price she paid. The long call is worth 1.10 at a stock price of 46.10, 
and the OCT 50 call will expire out of the money and thus be worthless. 
The breakeven price is the lower exercise price of 45 plus the 1.10 cost of the 
spread, or 46.10.

A long straddle  is an option combination in which one buys both  puts and calls, with 
the same exercise price and same expiration date, on the same underlying asset.20 If 
someone writes  both options, it is a short straddle. Because a long call is bullish and a 
long put is bearish, this strategy may seem illogical. When the Greeks are considered, 
the trader’s position becomes clearer. The classic example is in anticipation of some 
event in which the outcome is uncertain but likely to significantly affect the price of 
the underlying asset, regardless of how the event is resolved.
A straddle is an example of a directional play on the underlying volatility, expressing 
the view that volatility will either increase, for a long straddle, or decrease, for a short 
straddle, from its current level. A profitable outcome from a long straddle, however, 
usually requires a significant price movement in the underlying asset. The straddle 
buyer pays the premium for two options, so to make a profit, the underlying asset 
must move either above or below the option exercise price by at least the total amount 
spent on the straddle. As an example, suppose in the next few days there is a verdict 
20 If someone buys puts and calls with different exercise prices, the position is called a strangle .8
Straddle 41
expected in a liability lawsuit against an automobile manufacturer. An investor expects 
the stock to move sharply one way or the other once the verdict is revealed. When 
the exercise price is chosen close to the current stock price, the straddle is neither a 
bullish nor a bearish strategy—the delta of the straddle is close to zero. With any other 
exercise price, there may be a directional bias (non-zero delta) because one of the 
options will be in the money and one will be out of the money. If the price increases 
(decreases) significantly, the delta of the call will approach +1 (0), and the put delta 
will approach 0 (−1), making the delta of the position approximately +1 (−1).
Experienced option traders know that it is difficult to make money with a straddle. 
In the example, other people will also be watching the court proceedings. The market 
consensus will predict higher volatility once the verdict is announced, and option 
prices rise when volatility expectations rise. This increased volatility means that both 
the puts and the calls become expensive well before the verdict is revealed, and the 
long straddle requires the purchase of both options. To make money, the straddle 
buyer must be correct in his view that the “true” underlying volatility is higher than 
the market consensus. Essentially, the bet is that the straddle buyer is right and the 
other market participants, on average, are wrong by underestimating volatility.
Suppose the underlying stock sells for 50, and an investor selects 30-day options 
with an exercise price of 50. The call sells for 2.29 and the put for 2.28, for a total 
investment of 4.57. At prices above 50, the call is in the money. At prices below 50, 
the put is in the money. For the straddle to be profitable, one of these two options 
must be profitable enough to pay for the costs of both the put and call. To recover 
this cost, the underlying asset must either rise or fall by at least 4.57, as shown by the 
breakeven points in Exhibit 21 .

The straddle portfolio and Greeks are shown in Exhibit 22 . The long straddle initially 
has a very low delta (+0.069 for this example) with a high gamma (0.139). The trader 
does not initially favor an increase or a decrease in the share price but knows the delta 
may quickly change. Once a direction (increase or decrease in the underlying price) 
asserts itself, the trader’s position will take on a non-zero delta value. The trader’s view 
can be better understood from a vega perspective. The long straddle will be profitable 
only if the stock price moves enough to recover both premiums. The short straddle 
writer collects the put and call premiums but will lose if the stock price moves more 
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 42
than 4.57 away from the strike price. The long (short) straddle trade is said to be long 
(short) volatility. The long straddle is a bet that increased volatility will move the stock 
price strongly above or below the strike price. The sensitivity of the straddle to changes 
in volatility is measured by vega. As shown in Exhibit 22 , vega for our long straddle 
is +0.114, meaning the portfolio will profit by approximately 0.114 from increased 
volatility of 1% in the underlying. A stock price change large enough to cause the 
price of one option to exceed the cost of the combined premiums is needed to make 
the straddle trade profitable. A large increase in the underlying price will cause the 
delta of the call option to approach +1 and the delta of the put to approach 0. A large 
decrease in the underlying price will cause the delta of the call to drop to 0 and the 
put delta to approach −1.

Theoretically, the stock can rise to any level, so the maximum profit with the long 
call is unlimited. If the stock declines, it can fall to no lower than zero. If that hap -
pens, the long put would be worth 50. Subtracting the 4.57 cost of the straddle gives 
a maximum profit of 45.43 from a stock drop. The value of a straddle at expiration is 
the combined value of the call and the put:
 VT = Max(0, ST − X) + Max(0, X − ST). (9)
Broken down into ranges,
 VT = X − ST if ST < X, and
 VT = ST − X if ST > X.
 The profit is VT − V0, or Π = Max(0, ST − X) + Max(0, X − ST) − c0 − p0. (10)
Broken down into ranges,
 Π = X − ST − c0 − p0 if ST < X, and
 Π = ST − X − c0 − p0 if ST > X.
As can be seen in Exhibit 21 , the straddle has two breakeven points. The lower 
breakeven for the straddle is STL* = X − c0 − p0, and the upper breakeven is STH* = 
X + c0 + p0.
For the straddle buyer, the worst outcome is if the stock closes exactly at 50, 
meaning both the put and the call would expire worthless. At any other price, one of 
the options will have a positive exercise value. Note that at expiration, the straddle is 
not profitable if the stock price is in the range 45.43 to 54.57. The long straddle shown 
in Exhibit 21  requires more than a 9% price move in one month to be profitable. A 
trader who believed such a move was unlikely might be inclined to write  the straddle, 
in which case the profit and loss diagram in Exhibit 21  is reversed, with a maximum 
Straddle 43
gain of 4.57 and a theoretically unlimited loss if prices rise. The risk of a long strad -
dle is limited to the amount paid for the two option positions. The straddle can also 
be understood in terms of theta. As shown in Exhibit 22 , theta of the long straddle 
is −0.075. All else equal, the long put and call positions will lose their time value as 
expiration approaches. The long straddle buyer is betting on a large price move in 
the underlying prior to expiration. If the stock price does not change significantly, the 
short straddle, which has a positive theta, will benefit from the erosion of time value 
of the short put and call positions.
Collars
A collar  is an option position in which the investor is long shares of stock and then 
buys a put with an exercise price below the current stock price and writes a call with 
an exercise price above the current stock price.21 Collars allow a shareholder to acquire 
downside protection through a protective put but reduce the cash outlay by writing 
a covered call. By carefully selecting the options, an investor can often offset most 
of the put premium paid by the call premium received. Using a collar, the profit and 
loss on the equity position is limited by the option positions.
For equity investors, the collar typically entails ownership of the underlying 
asset and the purchase of a put, which is financed with the sale of a call. In a typical 
investment or corporate finance setting, an interest rate collar may be used to hedge 
interest rate risk on floating-rate assets or liabilities. For example, a philanthropic 
foundation funds the grants it makes from income generated by its investment port -
folio of floating-rate securities. The foundation’s chief investment officer (CIO) wants 
to hedge interest rate risk (the risk of rates falling on its floating securities) by buying 
an interest rate floor (a portfolio of interest rate puts) and paying for it by writing a 
cap (a portfolio of interest rate calls). Should the rates on the portfolio fall, the long 
floor will provide a lower limit for the income generated by the portfolio. To finance 
the floor purchase, the foundation sells a cap. The cap will limit the income generated 
from the floating rate portfolio in the event the floating rate rises. The CIO is still 
holding a floating-rate securities portfolio but has restricted the returns using the 
collar. By setting both a minimum and a maximum portfolio return, the CIO may be 
better able to plan funding requests.
Collars on an Existing Holding
A zero-cost collar involves the purchase of a put and sale of a call with the same pre -
mium. In Exhibit 6 , for instance, the NOV 15 put costs 1.46 and the NOV 17 call is 
1.44, very nearly the same. A collar written in the over-the-counter market can be easily 
structured to provide a precise offset of the put premium with the call premium.22
The value of the collar at expiration is the sum of the value of the underlying asset, 
the value of the long put (struck at X1), and the value of the short call (struck at X2):
 VT = ST + Max(0, X1 − ST) − Max(0, ST − X2), where X2 > X1. (11)
The profit is the profit on the underlying share plus the profit on the long put and 
the short call so that:
21 A collar is also called a fence  or a hedge wrapper .
22 Most collars are structured so that the call and put premiums completely offset each other. If the 
investor starts with the put at a specific exercise price, he then sells a call that has the same premium. 
There is one specific call with the same premium, and it has a particular exercise price, which is above 
the exercise price of the put. An algorithm can be used to search for the exercise price on the call that has 
the same premium as that of the put, which is then the call that the investor should sell. Most collars are 
structured and transacted in the over-the-counter market because the exercise price on the call must be 
a specific one. Exchange-traded options have standardized exercise prices, whereas the exercise prices of 
over-the-counter options can be set at whatever the investor wants.
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 44
 Π  =  ST + Max(0, X1 − ST) − Max(0, ST − X2) − S0 − p0 + c0. (12)
Broken down into ranges, the total profit on the portfolio is as follows:
 Π = X1 − S0 − p0 + c0 if ST ≤ X1
 Π = ST − S0 − p0 + c0 if X1 < ST < X2
 Π = X2 − S0 − p0 + c0 if ST ≥ X2
Consider the risk–return trade-off for a shareholder who previously bought PBR 
stock at 12 and now buys the NOV 15 put for 1.46 and simultaneously writes the 
NOV 17 covered call for 1.44. Exhibit 23  shows a profit and loss worksheet for the 
three positions. Exhibit 24  shows the profit and loss diagram.

At or below the put exercise price of 15, the collar realizes a profit of X1 − S0 − p0 + 
c0 = 15 − 12 − 1.46 + 1.44 = 2.98. At or above the call exercise price of 17, the profit 
is constant at X2 − S0 − p0 + c0 = 17 − 12 − 1.46 + 1.44 = 4.98.
In this example, because the stock price had appreciated before establishing the 
collar, the position has a minimum gain of at least 2.98 as shown in Exhibit 24 . Investors 
typically establish a collar on a position that is already outstanding.

The Risk of a Collar
We have already discussed the risks of covered calls and protective puts. The collar 
is essentially the simultaneous holding of both of these positions. See Exhibit 25  for 
the return distribution of a collar. A collar sacrifices the positive part of the return 
distribution in exchange for the removal of the adverse portion. With the short call 
option, the option writer sold the right side of the return distribution, which includes 
the most desirable outcomes. With the long put, the investor is protected against the 
left side of the distribution and the associated losses. The option premium paid for 
the put is largely and, often precisely, offset by the option premium received from 
writing the call. The collar dramatically narrows the distribution of possible invest -
ment outcomes, which is risk reducing. In exchange for the risk reduction, the return 
potential is limited.
The risks of the collar can be understood in terms of the Greeks from Exhibit 6 . For 
example, with a long share the delta of the portfolio = +1. With a collar, the portfolio 
delta is equal to the delta of the share plus the delta of the long NOV 15 put (−0.359) 
and short NOV 17 call (−0.475), so the portfolio delta = +1 + (−0.359) + (−0.475) = 
+0.166. Portfolio gamma, which equals put gamma minus call gamma, will be close 
to zero, −0.011 (= 0.075 − 0.086). By writing a call and buying a put, the investor 
reduces the portfolio’s delta at a price of 15.84 from +1 to +0.166 and the gamma is 
very close to zero. If the stock price moves outside the range depicted in Exhibit 25 , 
the delta of the position will approach zero over time. If the share price moves above 
17, the NOV 17 call approaches a delta of +1, and the put will approach a delta of 0. 
The collar is short the call, so above 17 the portfolio delta (long stock with delta = 
+1 plus a short call with delta = −1) will approach zero. At prices below 15, the NOV 
17 call will have a delta approaching 0, but the long put approaches a delta of −1, so 
the portfolio delta will again approach zero (long stock with delta = +1 plus the long 
put with delta = −1). The portfolio’s sensitivity to changes in the stock price will be 
limited, as shown in Exhibit 25 .

As the chosen put and call exercise prices move successively farther in opposite 
directions from the current price, the combined collar position begins to replicate the 
underlying gain/loss pattern of a long position in the underlying security. Conversely, 
as the chosen strike prices approach and meet each other, the expected returns and 
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 46
volatility become less and less equity-like and eventually converge on those of a 
risk-free, fixed income return to the time horizon. Thus, a collar position is, econom -
ically, intermediate between pure equity and fixed-income exposure.
The Risk of Spreads
Note that the shape of the profit and loss diagram for the bull spread in Exhibit 17  is 
similar to that of the collar in Exhibit 24 . The upside return potential is limited, but 
so is the maximum loss. As with the risk–return tradeoff with the collar, an option 
spread takes the tails of the distribution out of play and leaves only price uncertainty 
between the option exercise prices. Looking at this scenario another way, if someone 
were to simply buy a long call, the maximum gain would be unlimited and the maxi -
mum loss would be the option premium paid. If someone decides to convert this to a 
spread, doing so limits the maximum gain while simultaneously reducing the total cost.
Calendar Spread
A strategy in which one sells an option and buys the same type of option but with 
different expiration dates, on the same underlying asset and with the same strike, is 
commonly referred to as a calendar spread . When the investor buys the more distant 
call and sells the near-term call, it is a long calendar spread. The investor could also buy 
a near-term call and sell a longer-dated one, known as a short calendar spread. Calendar 
spreads can also be done with puts; the investor would still buy a long-maturity put 
and sell a near-term put with the same strike and underlying to create a long calendar 
spread. As discussed previously, a portion of the option premium is time value. Time 
value decays over time and approaches zero as the option expiration date nears. Taking 
advantage of this time decay is a primary motivation behind a calendar spread. Time 
decay is more pronounced for a short-term option than for one with a long time until 
expiration. A calendar spread trade seeks to exploit this characteristic by purchasing 
a longer-term option and writing a shorter-term option.
Here is an example of how someone might use a calendar spread. Suppose XYZ 
stock is trading at 45 a share in August. XYZ has a new product to be introduced to 
the public early the following year. A trader believes this new product introduction 
will have a positive effect on the share price. Until the excitement associated with this 
announcement starts to affect the stock price, the trader believes that the stock will 
languish around the current level. See the option prices, deltas and thetas in Exhibit 
26. Based on the bullish outlook for the stock going into January, the trader purchases 
the XYZ JAN 45 call with a theta (indicator of daily price erosion) of −0.014 for a price 
of 3.81. Noting that the near-term price forecast is neutral, the trader also decides 
to sell the XYZ SEP 45 call for 1.55. The theta for the XYZ SEP 45 Call is −0.029. 
The position costs 2.26 (= 3.81 − 1.55) to create and has an initial theta of +0.015 (= 
−0.014 − (−0.029)). If the stock price of XYZ remains constant over the next 30 days, 
the XYZ SEP 45 call will lose time value more rapidly than the JAN 45 call. The delta 
of calendar spread equals the delta of the JAN 45 call less the delta of the SEP 45 call 
and will be very low (Delta = +0.041 = 0.572 − 0.531).
Now move forward to the September expiration and assume that XYZ is trading 
at 45. The September option will now expire with no value, which is a good outcome 
for the calendar spread trader. The value of the position (now just the XYZ JAN 45 
call) is 3.48, a gain of 1.22 over the position cost of 2.26. If the trader still believes that 
XYZ will stay around 45 into October before starting to move higher, the trader may 
continue to execute this strategy. An XYZ OCT 45 call might be sold for 1.55 with 
the hope that it also expires with no value.

In this example, the calendar spread trader has a directional opinion on the stock 
but does not believe that the price movement is imminent. Rather, the trader sees 
an opportunity to capture time value in one or more shorter-lived options that are 
expected to expire worthless.
A short calendar spread is created by purchasing the near-term option and selling 
a longer-dated option. Thetas for in-the-money calls may provide motivation for a 
short calendar spread. For in-the-money calls, note the near dated SEP option has a 
lower rate of theta decay (−0.007) than the far dated OCT decay rate (−0.011). This is 
the opposite of the relationship we observerd in at-the-money calls. Assume a trader 
purchases the XYZ SEP 40 call with a theta of −0.007 for a price of 5.15. The trader 
sells the OCT 40 call with a theta of −0.011 for 5.47 to offset the cost of the SEP 40 
call. The position nets the trader a cash inflow of 0.32 (= 5.47 − 5.15), and the initial 
position theta is slightly positive −0.007 − (−0.011) = +0.004.
If the stock price of XYZ remains at 45 (above the strike of 40) at the SEP expira -
tion, the XYZ OCT 40 call will lose time value more rapidly than the SEP 40 call. The 
trader may close the position at the SEP expiration and make a profit of 0.17 = 0.32 
+ (5 − 5.15). Note that the profit consists of the 0.32 initial inflow plus the net cost 
of selling the SEP 40 call (at 5.00) and buying the OCT 40 call (at 5.15). In the event 
of a larger move, the position values will vary. For a large down move, for example 
an extreme case in which XYZ loses all of its value (so S = 0 at expiration), the long 
and the short call positions will be approximately worthless and the profit on the 
spread will be around 0.32 (= 0.32 + [0 − 0])). For a smaller down move to the strike 
price ( S = 40 at expiration), the short calendar spread may result in a loss. If the XYZ 
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 48
stock price were to fall to 40 at the SEP expiration, the long position in the SEP 40 
call would expire worthless but the OCT 40 call would still have a BSM model value 
of about 1.00 (not shown in Exhibit 26 ). This scenario would result in a loss of 0.68 
= 0.32 + (0 − 1) to close the position. The writer of a calendar spread would typically 
be looking for a large move away from the strike price in either direction.
In sum, a big move in the underlying market or a decrease in implied volatility 
will help a short calendar spread, whereas a stable market or an increase in implied 
volatility will help a long calendar spread. Thus, calendar spreads are sensitive to 
movement of the underlying but also sensitive to changes in implied volatility.
IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND VOLATILITY SKEW
discuss volatility skew and smile
An important factor in the current price of an option is the outlook for the future 
volatility of the underlying asset’s returns, the implied volatility . Implied volatility 
is not observable per se, but it is derived from an option pricing model—such as the 
Black–Scholes–Merton (BSM) model—and it is value that equates the model price of 
an option to its market price. Note that all other input variables to the BSM model, 
including the option’s strike price, the price of the underlying, the time to option expi -
ration, and the risk-free interest rate, are observable. Implied volatilities incorporate 
investors’ expectations about the future course of financial asset returns and the level 
of market uncertainty associated with them.
Implied volatilities for options on a specific asset may differ with strike price (i.e., 
moneyness), side (i.e., put or call), and time to expiration. In particular, out-of-the-money 
(OTM) puts typically command higher implied volatilities than ATM or OTM calls. 
This phenomenon is attributed to investors’ reassessments of the probabilities of 
negative “fat-tailed” market events such as the 2007–2009 global financial crisis.
Implied volatility is often compared with realized volatility  (i.e., historical vola -
tility), which is the square root of the realized variance of returns and measures the 
range of past returns for the underlying asset. To calculate the historical volatility for 
the given option, stock, or equity index, a series of past prices is needed. For example, 
to calculate the volatility of the S&P 500 Index over the past month (i.e., 21 trading 
days), it is necessary to first calculate the daily percentage change for each day’s index 
closing price. This is done using the following formula, where Pt is the closing price 
and Pt−1 is the prior day’s closing price: ( Pt − Pt−1)/Pt−1. The next step is to apply the 
standard deviation formula you learned in Level I Quantitative Methods to the daily 
percentage change data to calculate the standard deviation (i.e., volatility) of the S&P 
500 for the selected period, which in this case is the past month.
The standard deviation over the past month is then annualized by multiplying by 
the square root of the number of periods in a year. Because we assume the average 
number of trading days in a year and in a month are 252 and 21 (excluding weekends 
and holidays), respectively, the formula is:
   σ  Annual     (  % )     =  σ  Monthly     (  % )     √ _
   252 _ 21     . (13)
Note that this example uses one month of daily return data, but the process is equally 
applicable to any other period.
Obviously, we cannot use the previous formula for realized volatility, which is based 
on past prices, to obtain implied volatility, which is the expected volatility of future 
returns of the underlying asset. Instead, the one-month annualized implied volatility 9
Implied Volatility and Volatility Skew 49
can be derived from the current price of an option maturing in one month by using 
the BSM model. Once the one-month annualized implied volatility is obtained, it can 
then be converted into an estimate of the volatility expected on the underlying asset 
over the 21-day life of the option. This expected monthly volatility is given by the 
one-month annualized implied volatility divided by the square root of the number of 
21-day periods in a 252-day trading year, as follows:
   σ  Monthly     (  % )     =  σ  Annual     (  % )     /  √ _
   252 _ 21      (14)
When option prices are compared within or across asset classes or relative to their 
historical values, they are assessed by their implied volatility. Exhibit 27  shows a 
comparison of the one-month annualized (ATM) implied volatility at a given point 
in time for options across three European equity indexes (Euro Stoxx 50, FTSE MIB, 
and DAX). The DAX shows the lowest implied volatility among the three indexes.
Exhibit 27: One-Month Annualized Implied Volatility
Underlying Index Implied Volatility Three-Y ear Low Three-Y ear High
Euro Stoxx 50 9.56 9.0 17.9
FTSE MIB 14.22 11.0 21.7
DAX 9.29 7.3 13.9
Using the one-month annualized implied volatility for DAX index options of 9.29%, the 
volatility expected to materialize in the DAX index over the next month (21 trading 
days) can be calculated as follows:
   σ  Monthly     (  % )     = 9.29% /  √ _
   252 _ 21     = 2.68% 
So, for example, if an investor buys an ATM one-month (21-day) straddle using puts 
and calls on the DAX, in order for the strategy to be profitable at expiration, the 
index must move up or down by at least 2.68%. The investor can compare this price 
movement needed to reach breakeven with the DAX’s realized volatility over similar 
time horizons in the past. If such a price change is considered reasonable, then the 
investor can elect to implement the strategy.
The implied volatility of ATM options, calculated from the options’ market prices 
using the BSM model, remains the simplest way to measure the prevailing volatility 
level. The BSM model assumes that volatility is constant, and notably, before the 1987 
stock market crash, there was little volatility skew in equity index markets. Today, 
however, options prices on several asset classes display persistent volatility skew and, 
in some circumstances, volatility smile. The implied volatilities of options of a given 
expiration are thus dependent on their strike prices.
Exhibit 28  plots implied volatility ( y-axis) against strike price ( x-axis) for options 
on the same underlying, the FTSE MIB (trading at 19,000), with the same expiration. 
When the implied volatilities priced into both OTM puts and calls trade at a premium 
to implied volatilities of ATM options (those with strike price at 19,000), the curve is 
U-shaped and is called a volatility smile , because it resembles the shape of a smile. 
The more common shape of the implied volatility curve, however, is a volatility 
skew , where the implied volatility increases for OTM puts and decreases for OTM 
calls, as the strike price moves away from the current price. This shape persists across 
asset classes and over time because investors have generally less interest in OTM 
calls whereas OTM put options have found universal demand as portfolio insurance 
against a market sell-off.

Strike Price
The extent of the skew depends on several factors, including investor sentiment and the 
relative supply/demand for puts and calls, among others. Several theoretical models try 
to use these factors to forecast skew variation. However, these models do not lead to 
unique predictions. In general, we can say that when the implied volatility is significantly 
higher (relative to historical levels) for puts with strike prices below the underlying 
asset's price, it means that there is an imbalance in the supply and demand for options. 
In fact, when investors are looking to hedge the underlying asset, the demand for put 
options exceeds that for call options. Option traders, who meet this excess demand 
by selling puts, increase the relative price of these options, thereby raising the implied 
volatility. A sharp increase in the level of the skew, accompanied with a surge in the 
absolute level of implied volatility, is an indicator that market sentiment is turning 
bearish. In contrast, higher implied volatilities (relative to historical levels) for calls 
with strike prices above the underlying asset's price indicate that investors are bullish 
and the demand for OTM calls to take on upside exposure is strong.
To better understand how to measure the volatility skew, consider Exhibit 29 , 
which shows the levels of implied volatility at different degrees of moneyness for 
options expiring in three months on equity indexes where liquid derivatives markets 
exist. The 90% moneyness option is a put with strike ( X) equal to 90% of the current 
underlying price ( S); thus X/S = 90%. The 110% moneyness of the call is calculated 
similarly. Also shown is the skew, calculated as the difference between the implied 
volatilities of the 90% put and the 110% call.

For most asset classes, the level of option skew varies over time. Exhibit 30  presents 
the skew on the S&P 500, measured as the difference between the implied volatilities 
of options with 90% (puts) and 110% (calls) moneyness, and with three months to 
expiration.

There are trading strategies that attempt to profit from the existence of an implied 
volatility skew and from changes in its shape over time. A common strategy is to take 
a long or short position in a risk reversal , which is then delta hedged. Using OTM 
options, a combination of long (short) calls and short (long) puts on the same underly -
ing with the same expiration is a long (short) risk reversal. In particular, when a trader 
thinks that the put implied volatility is too high relative to the call implied volatility, 
she creates a long risk reversal, by selling the OTM put and buying the same expiration 
OTM call. The options position is then delta-hedged by selling the underlying asset. 
The trader is not aiming to profit from the movement in the overall level in implied 
volatility. In fact, depending on the strikes of the put and the call, the trade could be 
vega-neutral. For the trade to be profitable, the trader expects that the call will rise 
more (or decrease less) in implied volatility terms relative to the put.
Typically, implied volatility is not constant across different maturities, which means 
that options with the same strike price but with different maturities display different 
implied volatilities. This determines the term structure of volatility , which is often 
in contango, meaning that the implied volatilities for longer-term options are higher 
than for near-term ones. When markets are in stress and de-risking sentiment prevails, 
however, market participants demand short-term options, pushing up their prices and 
causing the term structure of volatility to invert. Exhibit 31  shows, for options on the 
S&P 500, a common indicator watched by market participants: the spread between 
the implied volatilities of 12-month and 3-month ATM options. Values below zero 
indicate that the term structure is inverted with 3-month options having a higher 
implied volatility than the 12-month options. In periods when equity markets expe -
rience large sell-offs, such as during the 2007–2009 global financial crisis, the term 
structure of implied volatility typically shows significant inversion. In such periods, 
the general level of equity volatility and skew also remain high.

The implied volatility surface  can be thought of as a three-dimensional plot, for put 
and call options on the same underlying asset, of days to expiration ( x-axis), option 
strike prices ( y-axis), and implied volatilities ( z-axis). It simultaneously shows the 
volatility skew (smile) and the term structure of implied volatility. Considering that 
implied volatility varies across different option maturities and displays skew, the implied 
volatility surface is typically not flat as the BSM model may suggest. By observing the 
implied volatility surface, one can infer changes in market expectations. Several stud -
ies have focused on ways to extract information embedded in option market prices. 
The skew can provide insight into market participants’ perceptions about the price 
movement of the underlying asset over a specified horizon. The general interpretation 
is that the shape of the volatility skew reflects varying degrees of market participants’ 
fear about future market stress.
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY 
SELECTION
identify and evaluate appropriate option strategies consistent with 
given investment objectives
The Necessity of Setting an Objective
Every trade is based on an outlook on the market. With stocks and most assets, one 
thinks about the direction of the market: Is it going up or down, or is it stable? When 
dealing with options, it is not enough to think about the market direction ; it is also 
important to think about the Greeks beyond delta: gamma, theta, and vega. Where 
option valuation is concerned, what matters is not only the direction in which the asset 
underlying the derivative contract is headed but also the volatility of the underlying and 
even other investors’ perception of that volatility. The investor’s investment objective 
may not be achieved if one of these factors moves in an undesired direction. Gamma 
could lead to a faster loss or gain, depending on whether the investor is short or long 
the option, whereas theta could lead to a loss despite the underlying asset moving in 
the right direction. Vega could rise or fall if market expectations of implied volatility 10
Investment Objectives and Strategy Selection 53
change, leading to a loss or profit for the options position. Furthermore, the option 
premium paid (if long) or received (if short) must be considered when calculating a 
position’s total profit and loss at maturity. For example, in a simple call option purchase, 
the underlying asset must go up enough so that the call option reaches breakeven by 
overcoming the premium paid for the call.
Moreover, with the introduction of volatility-based derivatives, investors increas -
ingly view these investments as a way to protect their portfolios against downside risk 
and also as a method to improve their portfolios’ efficiency. When considering hedging 
strategies, it is important to differentiate between situations in which the investor’s 
goal is to benefit from rising volatility (long volatility)—for example, in hedging a long 
stock position—and situations in which the investor wants to benefit from falling 
volatility (short volatility)—for example, by writing a short straddle position.
Derivatives are used by portfolio managers, traders, and corporations to adjust 
their risk exposures, to achieve a specific investment objective, or even to infer market 
expectations in the short term (for example, inferring market expectations for central 
banks’ interest rate decisions). The main advantage of derivatives is that they allow 
two parties with differing needs and market views to adjust quickly without having 
to enter into potentially costly and difficult trades in the underlying. Another advan -
tage of using derivatives instead of investing in the physical underlying securities is 
leverage. The fact that investors can take on a large exposure to the underlying asset 
by putting up only a fraction of the amount of risk capital is an important feature 
of derivatives. Liquidity is another key aspect favoring derivatives usage in many 
markets—for example, the ability to buy or sell credit protection using index credit 
derivatives (CDS) instead of trading the actual underlying, and likely less liquid, bonds 
provides a huge liquidity advantage to traders and investors. In sum, given an actual 
or anticipated portfolio of equities, bonds, rates, currencies, or other assets; a market 
outlook and a timeframe; and an understanding of the benefits and limitations of 
derivatives, it is important to set realistic investment objectives, be they for hedging, 
for taking direction bets, or for capturing arbitrage opportunities.
Criteria for Identifying Appropriate Option Strategies
Investors use derivatives to achieve a target exposure based on their outlook for the 
underlying asset. Exhibit 32  shows one way of looking at the interplay of direction and 
volatility. The strategies identified are most profitable given the expected change in 
implied volatility and the outlook for the direction of movement of the underlying asset.

Consider an investor who is bearish about a market. If he expects that implied vola -
tility will increase as the market sells off, then he will buy a put to protect his invest -
ments. If instead he believes that volatilities are expected to fall, writing a call would 
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 54
likely be a profitable strategy. Investors need to keep in mind, however, that the two 
strategies have two different payoffs and risk management implications. As we have 
seen previously, a position in which the investor writes the call and buys the put is a 
collar, and it is often associated with holding a long position in the underlying asset. 
Investors use collars against a long stock position to hedge risk and smooth volatil -
ity. In fact, by selling a covered call while purchasing a protective put, the investor 
establishes a combined position with fixed downside protection while still providing 
some opportunity for profits.
Now consider an investor who has a bullish view. Buying calls is an option strategy 
that will allow the investor to benefit if her outlook is correct and implied volatility 
increases. When implied volatilities are expected to fall, writing a put represents an 
alternative strategy to take advantage of a bullish market view with declining volatility. 
If this happens, the position will likely be profitable, because as the stock rises and 
implied volatility decreases, the short put moves farther out of the money and its price 
will decrease. The combined position in which the investor is long calls and short puts 
(i.e., a long risk reversal) is used to implement a bullish view (the investor buys the 
calls) while lowering the cost (the investor sells the puts) of the long position in the 
underlying asset that will be established upon exercising the options.
Investors can also decide to sell puts when they want to buy a stock only if the 
price declines below a determined target price (the strike price of the puts will be 
the same as this target price). In this case, by selling the put options when implied 
volatilities are elevated (and the puts are expensive), the investor can realize an effec -
tive stock purchase price that is less than the target (strike) price by the size of the 
premium received.
The purchase of call or put spreads tends to be most appropriate when the 
investor has a bullish view (call bull spread) or a bearish view (put bear spread) but 
the underlying market is not clearly trending upward or downward. Furthermore, 
such spreads are a way to reduce the total cost, given that the spread is normally 
constructed by buying one option and writing another. Importantly, if the implied 
volatility curve is skewed, with the implied volatility of OTM puts relatively higher 
than for nearer-to-the-money options, the cost of a bearish spread is even lower. This 
is because in the put bear spread, the lower exercise price, more OTM (but relatively 
more expensive) put is sold and the higher exercise price, nearer-to-the-money (but 
relatively less expensive) put is purchased.
Now suppose that the market is expected to trade in range. Again, the investor 
should consider volatility. Suppose he believes the current consensus estimate of 
volatility implied in option prices is too low and the rate of the change in underlying 
prices will increase—that is, vega will increase. If the investor is neutral on market 
direction, the appropriate strategy will be a long straddle, because this strategy takes 
advantage of an increase in the long call or long put option prices in response to 
realization of the expected surge in volatility, vega, and gamma. At expiry, the long 
straddle will be profitable if the price of the call (put) is greater (less) than the upper 
(lower) breakeven price. In contrast, an investor who expects the market to trade in 
range and volatility to fall may want to write the straddle instead.
We now consider a strategy that combines a longer-term bullish/bearish outlook on 
the underlying asset with a near-term neutral outlook. This approach is the calendar 
spread (or time spread), a strategy using two options of the same type (puts or calls) 
and same strike price but with different maturity dates. Typically, a long calendar 
spread—wherein the shorter-maturity option is sold and the longer-maturity option 
is purchased—is a long volatility trading strategy because the longer-term option has 
a higher vega than the shorter-term option. The maximum profit is obtained when 
the short-term option expires worthless, then implied volatility surges, increasing the 
price of the remaining long-term option. Although the delta for a calendar spread is 
approximately zero, gamma is not, so the main risk for the calendar strategy is that 
Options in Portfolio Management 55
the underlying stock price moves too fast and too far from the strike prices. For this 
reason, the calendar spread is typically implemented in option markets characterized 
by low implied volatility when the underlying stock is expected to remain in a trading 
range, but only until the maturity of the short-term option.

This section uses “mini cases” to illustrate some of the ways in which different market 
participants use derivative products to solve a problem or to alter a risk exposure. Note 
that with the wide variety of derivatives available, there are almost always multiple 
ways in which derivatives might logically be used in a particular situation. These mini 
cases cover only a few of them.
Covered Call Writing
Carlos Rivera is a portfolio manager in a small asset management firm focusing on 
high-net-worth clients. In mid-April, he is preparing for an upcoming meeting with 
Parker, a client whose daughter is about to marry. Parker and her husband have just 
decided to pay for their daughter’s honeymoon and need to raise $30,000 relatively 
quickly. The client’s portfolio is 70% invested in equities and 30% in fixed income 
and is by policy slightly aggressive. Currently the Parkers are “asset rich and cash 
poor, ” having largely depleted their cash reserves prior to the wedding expenses. The 
recently revised investment policy statement permits most option activity except the 
writing of naked calls.
Parker’s account contains 5,000 shares of Manzana (MNZA) stock, a stock that 
she is considering selling in the near future. Rivera’s firm has a bearish market outlook 
for MNZA shares over the next six months. Rivera reviews information on the 44-day 
exchange-listed options, which expire in May (shown in Exhibit 33 ). He is considering 
writing MNZA calls, which will accomplish two objectives. First, the sale of calls will 
generate the required cash for his client. Secondly, the sale will reduce the delta of 
Parker’s account in line with his firm’s bearish short-term outlook for MNZA shares. 
The current delta of Parker’s MNZA position is 5,000(+1) or +5,000. Exhibit 33  con -
tains call and put price information for May MNZA options with strike prices close 
to the current market price of MNZA shares ( S0 = $169).

Discuss the factors that Rivera should consider and the strategy he should recommend 
to Parker.
Solution:
To generate cash, Rivera will want to write options. The account permits the writing 
of covered calls. Manzana options trade on an organized exchange with a standard 
contract size of 100 shares per contract. With 5,000 shares in the account, 50 call 
contracts would be covered.
If Rivera were to write the MAY 180 calls, doing so would not generate the required 
cash, $2.50 × 100 × 50 = $12,500. Writing the MAY 165 calls would generate more 
than enough income: $9.10 × 100 × 50 = $45,500. However, the May 165 call is in 
the money. Although the firm’s outlook is bearish for the shares, Rivera feels there is 
a high likelihood of Parker’s MNZA shares being called away at expiration. Writing 
the May 175 call would generate only $4.03 × 100 × 50 = $20,150. Although Rivera 
believes the 175 call would not be exercised, the cash generated would be only about 
two-thirds of the client’s projected need. The May 170 call would generate $6.45 × 100 
× 50 = $32,250, which looks good from a cash-generation perspective. The current 
price of MNZA shares is 169, so there is a considerable risk that MNZA shares will 
sell above that level at expiration. If MNZA stock trades above the strike price at the 
May expiration, then Parker would be exposed to having her shares called at 170. 
Given the firm’s bearish outlook for MNZA shares and, as stated previously, “Parker 
is considering selling the stock in the near future, ” this risk might be acceptable. Using 
the May 170 call option data from Exhibit 33 , the delta of Parker’s MNZA position 
would be reduced from +5,000 to 5,000 × (+1 − 0.504) = +2,480.23 The profit graph 
for the recommended sale of 50 May 170 call contracts against Parker’s 5,000 share 
long position at 169 is shown in Exhibit 34 .
23 Delta for the short calls will approach −1 if the stock price moves strongly above 170 close to maturity. 
The likelihood of the shares being called away in that scenario would push the position delta to 0 (= +5000 
from the shares, −5000 for the short ITM calls).

The $32,250 generated by the call option sales is Parker’s to keep. There are two risks, 
however, that Rivera should point out to Parker using Exhibit 34 . The first risk is that 
his outlook for MNZA shares might be incorrect. The reduced delta may cost his client 
a potential gain on the long position. If MNZA shares increase above 170, the profits 
will go to the call owner. Parker’s MNZA shares may be called away at 170, limiting 
her profit to the option premium of $32,250 plus the $5,000 from selling her MNZA 
shares at a profit of $1 (= $170 − $169) as shown in Exhibit 34 .24 The second risk is 
that to write the covered call, Parker must continue to hold 5,000 MNZA shares. If the 
firm’s bearish outlook is correct, the shares may drop in value during the next month, 
resulting in a loss on the long stock position. The loss would be cushioned somewhat 
by the 6.45 call premium, but a drop of more than 3.8% (below 162.55 = 169 − 6.45; 
6.45/169 = 3.8%) results in an overall loss on the position. After Rivera explains the 
risks to Parker, she elects to write the MNZA 170 calls.
Put Writing
Oscar Quintera is the chief financial officer for Tres Jotas, a private investment firm 
in Buenos Aires. He wants to purchase 50,000 MNZA shares for the firm, but at the 
current price he considers MNZA shares to be a bit expensive. The current share 
price is $169, and Quintera is willing to buy the stock at a price not higher than $165. 
Quintera decides to write out-of-the-money puts on MNZA shares.
Discuss the outcome of the transaction, a short position in MNZA May 165 puts, 
assuming two scenarios:
 ■Scenario A: MNZA is $163 per share on the option expiration day.
 ■Scenario B: MNZA is $177 per share on the option expiration day.
24 Note that if the shares are called away at 170, there may also be tax consequences for Parker.
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 58
Solution:
Quintera can write OTM puts to effectively “get paid” to buy the stock. He sells puts 
and the firm keeps the cash regardless of what happens in the future. If the stock is 
above the exercise price at expiration, the put options will not be exercised. Otherwise, 
the option is exercised, Quintera purchases the stock and, as desired, Tres Jotas 
becomes an owner of the stock. Exhibit 33  shows the options information for 44-day 
MAY put options. Because his target price is 165, Quintera writes 500 May MNZA 
165 put contracts and receives premium income of 500 × 100 × $5.30 = $265,000. The 
company keeps these funds regardless of future stock price movements. But, the firm 
is obligated to buy stock at $165 if the put holder chooses to exercise. By writing the 
puts, Quintera has established a bullish position in MNZA stock. The delta of this 
MNZA position is −500 × 100 × −0.384 = +19,200, the equivalent of a long position 
in 19,200 MNZA shares. The portfolio profit on the short put is shown in Exhibit 35 .

Scenario A:
The stock is $163 per share on the option expiration day. With an exercise price of 
165, the put is in the money and will be exercised. Quintera will be assigned to buy 
50,000 shares at the exercise price of 165. The cost is 50,000 × $165 = $8,250,000. 
Quintera is satisfied with the outcome, because the firm keeps the premium income 
of $265,000, so the net cost of purchase is $8,250,000 − $265,000 = $7,985,000. On 
50,000 shares, this means the effective purchase price  is $7,985,000/50,000 = $159.70, 
which is below the maximum $165 price Quintera was willing to pay. If the price of 
MNZA shares drops below 165, the effective purchase price will always be X − p = 
165 − 5.30 = $159.70. This is the breakeven point for the short put position. At prices 
below the breakeven amount, Quintera would have been better off not writing the put 
and just buying MNZA shares outright. For example, if the MNZA price fell to $150, 
Quintera would have been obligated to buy shares at 165, $15 more than the market 
price. When the $5.30 premium is considered, the $15 difference would amount to a 
loss of $9.70 per share or $485,000 which can be seen in Exhibit 35 .

The stock price is $177 on the option expiration day. With an exercise price of 165.00, 
the MNZA puts are out of the money and would not be exercised. Tres Jotas keeps the 
$265,000 premium received from writing the option. This approach adds to the com -
pany’s profitability, but Tres Jotas did not acquire the MNZA shares and experienced 
an opportunity cost relative to an outright purchase of the stock at $169. Any price 
above 165, will result in earning the premium of $265,000, as can be seen in Exhibit 35 .
Long Straddle
Katrina Hamlet has been following Manzana stock for the past year. She anticipates 
the announcement of a major new product soon, but she is not sure how the critics 
will react to it. If the new product is praised, she believes the stock price will increase 
dramatically. If the product does not impress, she believes the share price will fall 
substantially. Hamlet has been considering trading around the event with a straddle. 
The stock is currently priced at $169.00, and she is focused on close-to-the-money 
(170) calls and puts selling for 6.45 and 7.69, respectively. Her initial strategy is pre -
sented as Exhibit 36 .
Hamlet expects that the stock will move at least 10% either way once the product 
announcement is made, making the straddle strategy potentially appropriate. The vega 
of her position would be 0.234 + 0.234= +0.468, meaning a 1% move in the options’ 
volatility would result in a gain of about $0.468 in the value of the straddle. The strad -
dle’s delta would be approximately zero, at +0.01 (Call Delta + Put Delta = (0.504 + 
[−0.494]). This strategy is long volatility. After the market close, Hamlet hears a news 
story indicating that the product will be unveiled at a trade show in two weeks. The 
following morning after the market opens, she goes to place her trade and finds that 
although the stock price remains at $169.00, the option prices have adjusted upward 
to $10.20 for the call and $10.89 for the put.
Discuss whether the new option premiums have any implications for Hamlet’s 
intended straddle strategy.

Solution:
Hamlet is betting on a substantial price movement in the underlying MNZA shares 
to make money with this trade. That price movement, up or down, must be large 
enough to recover the two premiums paid. In her earlier planning, that total was 
$6.45 + $7.69 = $14.14. She expects at least a 10% price movement, which on a stock 
selling for $169.00 would be an increase of $16.90. This price movement would be 
sufficient to recover the $14.14 cost of the straddle and make her strategy profitable. 
The breakeven points were $155.86 and $184.14, as shown in Exhibit 36 .
The news report about the imminent product unveiling, however, has increased the 
implied volatility in the options, from about 30% to about 45%, raising their prices and 
making it more difficult to achieve the new breakeven points. After the news report, 
Hamlet finds the MAY 170 call now costs $10.20 and the MAY 170 put is trading 
for $10.89, so the MAY 170 straddle costs $21.09 ($10.20 + $10.89) to implement. 
Relating back to the vega she calculated the day before, Hamlet computed an initial 
vega (pre-announcement) of +0.468 for the straddle. Now she sees the approximate 15 
percentage point rise in implied volatility (to 45%) in both the put and call. According 
to her initial vega calculation, she would expect an increase of 15 × 0.468 = $7.02 in 
her straddle value after the announcement. The announcement increased the price 
of the straddle by $6.95 (= 21.09 − 14.14), which is very close to the $7.02 increase 
predicted by the vega calculation. To reach the new breakeven points (170 ± 21.09), 
she now needs the stock to move by more than 12%, a larger move than 10% from 
the current level of 169. Given that Hamlet expects only a 10% price movement, she 
decides against executing this straddle trade.
EXAMPLE 7
Straddle Analytics
Use the following information to answer Questions 1 to 3 on straddles.
 XYZ stock price = 100.00
 100-strike call premium = 8.00
 100-strike put premium = 7.50
 Options expire in three months
1. If Yelena Strelnikov, a portfolio manager, buys a straddle on XYZ stock, she 
is best described as expecting a:
A. higher volatility market.
B. lower volatility market.
C. stable volatility market.
Solution:
A is correct. A straddle is directionally neutral in terms of price; it is neither 
bullish nor bearish. The straddle buyer wants higher volatility and wants 
it quickly but does not care in which direction the price of the underlying 
moves. The worst outcome is for the underlying asset to remain stable.
2. This strategy will break even at expiration stock prices of:
A. 92.50 and 108.50.
B. 92.00 and 108.00.
Options in Portfolio Management 61
C. 84.50 and 115.50.
Solution:
C is correct. To break even, the stock price must move enough to recover 
the cost of both the put and the call. These premiums total to $15.50, so the 
stock must move up at least to $115.50 or down to $84.50.
3. Reaching an upside breakeven point implies an annualized rate of return on 
XYZ stock closest  to:
A. 16%.
B. 31%.
C. 62%.
Solution:
C is correct. The price change to a breakeven point is 15.50 points, or 
15.5% on a 100 stock. This is for three months. Ignoring compounding, this 
outcome is equivalent to an annualized rate of 62% on XYZ stock, found by 
multiplying by 12/3 (15.5% × 4 = 62%).
Collar
Bernhard Steinbacher has a client with a holding of 100,000 shares in Tundra 
Corporation, currently trading for €14 per share. The client has owned the shares 
for many years and thus has a very low tax basis on this stock. Steinbacher wants to 
safeguard the position’s value because the client does not want to sell the shares. He 
does not find exchange-traded options on the stock. Steinbacher wants to present 
a way in which the client could protect the investment portfolio from a decline in 
Tundra’s stock price.
Discuss an option strategy that Steinbacher might recommend to his client.
Solution:
In the over-the-counter market, Steinbacher might buy a put and then write an 
out-of-the money call. This strategy is a collar. The put provides downside protection 
below the put exercise price, and the call generates income to help offset the cost of the 
put. The investor decides the strike prices of the put and the call to achieve a specific 
level of downside protection, while still keeping some benefit from an increase in the 
stock price. When the strike of the call is set so that the call premium (to be received) 
exactly offsets the put premium (to be paid), then the position is called a “zero-cost 
collar. ” Recalling Exhibit 25  and the underlying return distribution, this strategy effec -
tively sells the right tail of the distribution, which represents potential large gains, in 
exchange for eliminating the left tail, which represents potential large losses.
Calendar Spread
Ivanka Dubois is a professional advisor to high-net-worth investors. She expects lit -
tle price movement in the Euro Stoxx 50 in the next three months but has a bearish 
long-term outlook. The consensus sentiment favoring a flat market shows no signs 
of changing over the next few months, and the Euro Stoxx 50 is currently trading at 
3500. Exhibit 37  shows prices for two put options with strike price of 3500 that are 
available on the index. Both options have the same implied volatility.
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 62

  Option A Option B
Current Price €119 €173
Time to Maturity 3 months 6 months
1. Discuss how can Dubois take advantage of her out-of-consensus view.
2. Analyze four scenarios that Dubois might likely face for the Stoxx 50 index 
at the expiry of the three-month option (these scenarios are provided at the 
beginning of the Solution to 2).
Solution to 1:
Dubois’s view is best implemented with a long position in a calendar spread that 
combines a longer-term bearish outlook on the underlying asset with a near-term 
neutral outlook. She is bearish long-term and so would buy a calendar put spread. 
A long calendar spread is a long volatility trading strategy whereby the maximum 
profit is obtained when the short-term at the money option expires worthless with 
the underlying almost unchanged.
Dubois can implement a put calendar spread trade by selling the three-month 
put option (A) for €119 and buying the six-month same strike put option (B) at the 
price for €173. Therefore, the cost of establishing this strategy is a net debit of €54 per 
contract (given by €173 − €119). Remember, Dubois has a bearish long-term outlook. 
If the put calendar spread is not profitable at the expiry of the three-month put, the 
short option expires worthless and then she owns the longer-term option free and 
clear. Thus, Dubois has managed to lower the cost of purchasing a longer-term put 
option, which could be kept for hedging her portfolio’s downside risk.
Solution to 2:
If the put calendar spread position is held until the expiry of the three-month put, 
then Dubois might likely face one of the four following scenarios for the Euro Stoxx 
50. In the first three scenarios, the implied volatility is assumed to remain constant:
Scenario 1 The index is still trading at 3500 as expected.
Scenario 2 The index has increased and is trading at 4200.
Scenario 3 The index has decreased and is trading at 3000.
Scenario 4 The index has decreased and is trading at 3000, but the implied 
volatility has significantly increased.
Scenario 1:
The Euro Stoxx 50 is still trading at 3500 as expected. The three-month put option 
expires worthless, and the original longer-term six-month option, which now has 
three months remaining to expiration, is worth €119 (because the implied volatility 
has remained constant). The total cost of the calendar spread was €54, and Dubois 
can sell the remaining put to a dealer for a profit of €65 (given by €119 − €54). As 
can be seen in Exhibit 38 , which shows the profit and loss diagram for the calendar 
spread at the time of the expiration of the three-month put, this corresponds to the 
level of maximum payoff for this strategy.

Scenario 2:
The Euro Stoxx 50 has increased and is trading at 4200. The three-month put option 
expires worthless. Also, the value of the six-month put is near zero, and if Dubois 
unwinds her (long) put option position she will lose all €54 (given by €173 − €119), 
the cost of the put calendar spread.
Scenario 3:
The Euro Stoxx 50 index has decreased and is trading at 3000. Dubois must pay €500 
(€3,500 − €3,000) to settle the (short) three-month put option at expiration. The (long) 
put option with three months remaining to expiration is deep in the money and, 
assuming volatility is still unchanged and €15 of Time Value, it is worth €515 (given 
by Intrinsic Value of €500 + €15 of Time Value). If Dubois sells this put to a dealer, 
she will lose €39 (= €515 − €500 − €54) on the put calendar spread.
Scenario 4:
The Euro Stoxx 50 has decreased and is trading at 3000, and the implied volatility has 
significantly increased. Dubois must pay €500 (€3,500 − €3,000) to settle the (short) 
three-month put option at expiration. The (long) put option with three months 
remaining to expiration is deep in the money and, assuming volatility has increased 
and €30 of Time Value, it is worth €530 (given by Intrinsic Value of €500 + €30 of 
Time Value). If Dubois sells this put to a dealer, she will realize a loss of €24 (= €530 
− €500 − €54) on the put calendar spread. Exhibit 39  adds the profit and loss diagram 
for the calendar spread at the time of the expiration of the three-month put, assuming 
that implied volatility of the six-month put has significantly increased.

HEDGING AN EXPECTED INCREASE IN EQUITY 
MARKET VOLATILITY
demonstrate the use of options to achieve targeted equity risk 
exposures
Jack Wu is a fund manager who oversees a stock portfolio valued at US$50 million 
that is benchmarked to the S&P 500. He expects an imminent significant correction 
in the US stock market and wants to profit from an anticipated jump in short-term 
volatility to hedge his portfolio’s tail risk.
The VIX Index is currently at 14.87, and the front-month VIX futures trades at 
15.60. Wu observes the quotes shown in Exhibit 40  for options on the VIX (these 
options have same implied volatility). It is important to note that VIX option prices 
reflect the VIX futures prices. Given that the VIX futures trade at 15.60 while the 
spot VIX is 14.87, the call is at the money while the put is out of the money by 5.45% 
(= [14.75 − 15.60]/15.60).
At maturity, the options’ payoffs will depend on the settlement price of the rel -
evant VIX futures contracts. The options will expire one month from now, and the 
contract size is 100.

Hedging an Expected Increase in Equity Market Volatility 65
Discuss the following:
1. A strategy Wu can implement to hedge tail risk in his equity portfolio, by 
taking advantage of his expected increase in volatility while lowering his 
hedging cost
2. Profit and loss on the strategy at options expiration
3. Relevant issues and advantages of this strategy
Solution to 1:
Wu decides to purchase the 15.60 call on the VIX and, to partially finance the pur -
chase, he sells an equal number of the 14.75 VIX puts. The total cost of the options 
strategy is 0.45 (= 2.00 − 1.55) per contract.
Solution to 2:
At maturity, the options’ payoffs will depend on the settlement price of the relevant 
VIX futures. Exhibit 41  shows the profit and loss diagram for the option strategy at 
the time of the options’ expiration. In particular, the horizontal axis shows the values 
corresponding to the relevant VIX futures contracts.

Level of Underlying VIX Futur es
In this case, at the expiry the strategy will be profitable if volatility spikes up (as antic -
ipated) and the VIX futures increase above 16.05. This is calculated as the call strike 
of 15.60 plus the net cost of the options (15.60 + 0.45). Above this level, the strategy 
will gain proportionally. In contrast, Wu’s option strategy will lose proportionally to 
its exposure to the short puts if the VIX futures’ settlement price is below 14.75 (put 
strike).
Solution to 3:
The hedge ratio that determines the number of calls to buy could be determined based 
on regression and scenario analysis on the portfolio’s profit and loss versus rates of 
increase in implied volatility during significant stock market sell-offs in the past. Of 
course, a risk is that past correlations may not be indicative of future correlations. 
Importantly, the relative advantage of implementing this long volatility hedging strategy 
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 66
by purchasing calls on the VIX over buying VIX futures depends on the difference 
in leverage available, the difference in payoff profiles (asymmetrical for options and 
symmetrical for futures), and the shape of the volatility futures term structure, as well 
as the cost of the options compared with the cost of the index futures.
Establishing or Modifying Equity Risk Exposure
In this section, we examine some examples in which investors use derivatives for 
establishing an equity risk exposure, for risk management, or for implementing tacti -
cal asset allocation decisions. The choice of derivative that will satisfy the investment 
goal depends on the outlook for the underlying asset, the investment horizon, and 
expectations for implied volatility over that horizon.
Long Call
Armando Sanchez is a private wealth advisor working in London. He expects the 
shares of Markle Co. Ltd. will move from the current price of £60 a share to £70 a share 
over the next three months, thanks to an increase of positive news flows regarding 
the company’s new fintech services. He also expects that the implied volatilities of 
options on Markle’s stock will stay almost unchanged over the same period. Prices 
for three-month call options on the stock are shown in Exhibit 42  (note that each call 
contract represents one share). For his high-net-worth clients whose investment policy 
statements allow the use of derivatives, Sanchez plans to recommend that they purchase 
the call option that, based on the budget they intend to spend for implementing the 
strategy, would maximize profits if the stock price increases to £70 a share or more 
over the next three months.
Exhibit 42: Three-Month Call Options on Markle Co. Ltd.
  Option A Option B Option C
Strike £58.00 £60.00 £70.00
Price £4.00 £3.00 £0.40
Delta 0.6295 0.5227 0.1184
Gamma 0.0304 0.0322 0.0160
Discuss the option strategy that Sanchez should recommend to his clients.
Solution:
Sanchez has a bullish view because he anticipates a nearly 17% price increase in 
Markle shares over the next three months, from the current price of £60. He expects 
that implied volatilities of the options on Markle shares will stay unchanged, making 
the purchase of options a profitable strategy if his outlook materializes within the 
given timeframe.
The best strategy would be a long position in the £60 strike calls (option B). The 
breakeven price of the position is £63 (£60 + £3), so at option expiry, the overall posi -
tion would profitable at any stock price above £63. In contrast, the breakeven price 
of the 58-strike call (option A) is £62 (£58 + £4) and for the 70-strike call (option C) 
the breakeven is £70.40 (£70 + £0.40). Therefore, Sanchez would not use option C to 
implement his strategy because the breakeven price is above his target price of £70/
share.
Hedging an Expected Increase in Equity Market Volatility 67
Given the £60 strike call has a lower price (premium) than the £58 strike call, 
Sanchez’s clients can purchase more of these lower-priced options for a given invest -
ment size. Moreover, the 60-strike call offers the largest profit potential per unit of 
premium paid if the stock price increases to £70 (as expected).
 Call strike £58: (£70 − £62)/£4 = 2.0
 Call strike £60: (£70 − £63)/£3 = 2.3
Purchasing the £60 strike call (option B) is the most profitable strategy given that 
Sanchez’s expectations are realized. A position in the £60 strike call has a lower delta 
(= 0.5227) compared with the £58 strike call (delta = 0.6295), so at current prices of 
the underlying, the change in value of the £60 strike call is lower. If Markle’s stock 
reaches £70 per share during the life of the option, however, the £60 strike call will 
benefit from having a larger gamma (= 0.0322) compared with the £58 strike call 
(gamma = 0.0304).
Risk Management: Protective Put Position
Investors use protective puts, collars, and equity swaps against a long stock position 
to hedge market risk. Here we turn to a practical application of protective puts.
Eliot McLaire manages a Glasgow-based hedge fund that holds 100,000 shares of 
Relais Corporation, currently trading at €42.00.
Situation A: Before Relais Corporation’s quarterly earnings release:
Relais has a quarterly earnings announcement scheduled in one week. Although 
McLaire expects an earnings increase, he believes the company will miss the consensus 
earnings estimate, in which case he expects that the maximum drawdown from the 
current price of €42.00 would be 10%. He would like to protect the fund’s position 
in the company for several days around the earnings announcement while keeping 
the cost of the protection to a minimum. Exhibit 43  provides information on options 
prices for Relais Corporation. Note that each put contract represents one share.
Exhibit 43: One-Month Put Options on Relais Corporation
  Option A Option B Option C
Strike €40.00 €42.50 €45.00
Price €1.45 €1.72 €3.46
Delta −0.4838 −0.5385 −0.7762
Gamma 0.0462 0.0460 0.0346
1. Discuss an options strategy that McLaire can implement to hedge his fund’s 
portfolio against a short-term decline in the share price of Relais Corp.
Solution to 1:
McLaire can purchase a protective put with the intent of selling it soon after the 
earnings announcement. He expects that the maximum drawdown from the current 
price of €42.00 will be 10%, to €37.80. This expectation narrows the choice of put 
options based on the following breakeven prices:
 Put strike 40.0 (option A): €40.00 − €1.45 = €38.55
 Put strike 42.5 (option B): €42.50 − €1.72 = €40.78
 Put strike 45.0 (option C): €45.00 − €3.46 = €41.54
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 68
The put with strike price of 42.50 (option B) best fits the objective of keeping the cost 
of adequate protection to a minimum. This is because the 40-strike put (option A) 
offers limited protection because it is profitable only below €38.55, offering a profit 
of just €0.75 if the stock falls to €37.80. Furthermore, the 42.50-strike put offers a 
larger profit per unit of premium paid than the 45.00-strike put if the stock price 
decreases to €37.80.
 Put strike 42.5: (€40.78 − €37.80)/€1.72 = 1.73
 Put strike 45.0: (€41.54 − €37.80)/€3.46 = 1.08
The 42.50 strike put has a lower delta (= −0.5385) in absolute value terms than the 
45.0 strike put (delta = −0.7762), but it has more gamma. If Relais Corporation’s stock 
falls to €37.80 per share during the life of the option, a position in the 42.50 strike 
put will benefit from having a larger gamma (= 0.0460) compared with the 45.0 strike 
put (gamma = 0.0346).
Therefore, McLaire purchases 100,000 of the 42.50-strike puts at €1.72 for a total 
cost of €172,000.
If Relais Corporation’s soon-to-be announced earnings miss the market’s expec -
tations, the stock is likely to fall, thereby increasing the long put value and partially 
offsetting the loss on the stock. If the earnings meet market expectations, then the put 
may be sold at a price near its purchase price. If the earnings are better than expected 
and the stock price rises, then the put will decline in value. McLaire would no longer 
need the “insurance, ” and he would sell the put position, thereby recovering part of 
the purchase price.
Situation B: One week later, just after Relais Corporation’s earnings release:
McLaire holds the 100,000 puts with the exercise price of €42.50. Seven days have 
passed since the options’ purchase; Relais has just released its earnings, and they turn 
out to be surprisingly good. Earnings beat the consensus estimate, and immediately 
after the announcement the stock price rises by 5% to €44.10. Exhibit 44  shows the 
options’ prices on the day of the announcement, after the stock price has increased 
to €44.10 (the implied volatility remains unchanged).

2. Discuss how the strategy fared and how McLaire should proceed, assuming 
earnings beat the consensus estimate and Relais’s stock price rises by 5% to 
€44.10.
Solution to 2:
The 42.50-strike put held by McLaire has 23 days to expiration. The price has declined 
from €1.72 to €0.66 (−62%), for a total loss of €106,000 (= [€1.72 − €0.66] × 100,000). 
This is less than the loss McLaire would have incurred if he had purchased the other 
Hedging an Expected Increase in Equity Market Volatility 69
options. At the same time the value of the 100,000 Relais shares held by the fund 
has increased by €210,000 (= ($44.10 − $42.00) × 100,000). Now that the earnings 
announcement has been made, McLaire no longer needs the protection from the put 
options, so he should sell them and recover €66,000 from the original €172,000 put 
purchase price.
SUMMARY
This reading on options strategies shows a number of ways in which market partici -
pants might use options to enhance returns or to reduce risk to better meet portfolio 
objectives. The following are the key points.
 ■Buying a call and writing a put on the same underlying with the same strike 
price and expiration creates a synthetic long position (i.e., a synthetic long 
forward position).
 ■Writing a call and buying a put on the same underlying with the same strike 
price and expiration creates a synthetic short position (i.e., a synthetic short 
forward position).
 ■A synthetic long put position consists of a short stock and long call position 
in which the call strike price equals the price at which the stock is shorted.
 ■A synthetic long call position consists of a long stock and long put posi -
tion in which the put strike price equals the price at which the stock is 
purchased.
 ■Delta is the change in an option’s price for a change in price of the underly -
ing, all else equal.
 ■Gamma is the change in an option’s delta for a change in price of the under -
lying, all else equal.
 ■Vega is the change in an option’s price for a change in volatility of the under -
lying, all else equal.
 ■Theta is the daily change in an option’s price, all else equal.
 ■A covered call, in which the holder of a stock writes a call giving someone 
the right to buy the shares, is one of the most common uses of options by 
individual investors.
 ■Covered calls can be used to change an investment’s risk–reward profile by 
effectively enhancing yield or reducing/exiting a position when the shares 
hit a target price.
 ■A covered call position has a limited maximum return because of the trans -
fer of the right tail of the return distribution to the option buyer.
 ■The maximum loss of a covered call position is less than the maximum loss 
of the underlying shares alone, but the covered call carries the potential for 
an opportunity loss if the underlying shares rise sharply.
 ■A protective put is the simultaneous holding of a long stock position and a 
long put on the same asset. The put provides protection or insurance against 
a price decline.
 ■The continuous purchase of protective puts maintains the upside potential 
of the portfolio, while limiting downside volatility. The cost of the puts must 
be carefully considered, however, because this activity may be expensive. 
Conversely, the occasional purchase of a protective put to deal with a bear -
ish short-term outlook can be a reasonable risk-reducing strategy.
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 70
 ■The maximum loss with a protective put is limited because the downside 
risk is transferred to the option writer in exchange for the payment of the 
option premium.
 ■With an option spread, an investor buys one option and writes another of 
the same type. This approach reduces the position cost but caps the maxi -
mum payoff.
 ■A bull spread expresses a bullish view on the underlying and is normally 
constructed by buying a call option and writing another call option with a 
higher exercise price (both options have same underlying and same expiry).
 ■A bear spread expresses a bearish view on the underlying and is normally 
constructed by buying a put option and writing another put option with a 
lower exercise price (both options have same underlying and same expiry).
 ■With either a bull spread or a bear spread, both the maximum gain and the 
maximum loss are known and limited.
 ■A long (short) straddle is an option combination in which the investor buys 
(sells) puts and calls with the same exercise price and expiration date. The 
long (short) straddle investor expects increased (stable/decreased) volatility 
and typically requires a large (small/no) price movement in the underlying 
asset in order to make a profit.
 ■A collar is an option position in which the investor is long shares of stock 
and simultaneously writes a call with an exercise price above the current 
stock price and buys a put with an exercise price below the current stock 
price. A collar limits the range of investment outcomes by sacrificing upside 
gain in exchange for providing downside protection.
 ■A long (short) calendar spread involves buying (selling) a long-dated option 
and writing (buying) a shorter-dated option of the same type with the same 
exercise price. A long (short) calendar spread is used when the investment 
outlook is flat (volatile) in the near term but greater (lesser) return move -
ments are expected in the future.
 ■Implied volatility is the expected volatility an underlying asset’s return and 
is derived from an option pricing model (i.e., the Black–Scholes–Merton 
model) as the value that equates the model price of an option to its market 
price.
 ■When implied volatilities of OTM options exceed those of ATM options, 
the implied volatility curve is a volatility smile. The more common shape 
is a volatility skew, in which implied volatility increases for OTM puts and 
decreases for OTM calls, as the strike price moves away from the current 
price.
 ■The implied volatility surface is a 3-D plot, for put and call options on the 
same underlying, showing expiration time ( x-axis), strike prices ( y-axis), and 
implied volatilities ( z-axis). It simultaneously displays volatility skew and the 
term structure of implied volatility.
 ■Options, like all derivatives, should always be used in connection with 
a well-defined investment objective. When using options strategies, it is 
important to have a view on the expected change in implied volatility and 
the direction of movement of the underlying asset.

Aline Nuñes, a junior analyst, works in the derivatives research division of an in -
ternational securities firm. Nuñes’s supervisor, Cátia Pereira, asks her to conduct 
an analysis of various option trading strategies relating to shares of three compa -
nies: IZD, QWY, and XDF. On 1 February, Nuñes gathers selected option premi -
um data on the companies, presented in Exhibit 1.
Exhibit 1: Share Price and Option Premiums as of 1 February (share prices 
and option premiums in €)

XDF 74.98 2.54 April/75.00 3.22
    2.47 December/80.00 9.73
Nuñes considers the following option strategies relating to IZD:
Strategy 1:  Constructing a synthetic long put position in IZD
Strategy 2: Buying 100 shares of IZD and writing the April €95.00 strike call 
option on IZD
Strategy 3: Implementing a covered call position in IZD using the April 
€97.50 strike option
Nuñes next reviews the following option strategies relating to QWY:
Strategy 4:  Implementing a protective put position in QWY using the April 
€25.00 strike option
Strategy 5:  Buying 100 shares of QWY, buying the April €24.00 strike put 
option, and writing the April €31.00 strike call option
Strategy 6:  Implementing a bear spread in QWY using the April €25.00 and 
April €31.00 strike options
Finally, Nuñes considers two option strategies relating to XDF:
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 72
Strategy 7:  Writing both the April €75.00 strike call option and the April 
€75.00 strike put option on XDF

Stanley Kumar Singh, CFA, is the risk manager at SKS Asset Management. He 
works with individual clients to manage their investment portfolios. One client, 
Sherman Hopewell, is worried about how short-term market fluctuations over 
the next three months might impact his equity position in Walnut Corporation. 
Although Hopewell is concerned about short-term downside price movements, 
he wants to remain invested in Walnut shares because he remains positive about 
its long-term performance. Hopewell has asked Singh to recommend an option 
strategy that will keep him invested in Walnut shares while protecting against a 
short-term price decline. Singh gathers the information in Exhibit 1 to explore 
various strategies to address Hopewell’s concerns. 
Another client, Nigel French, is a trader who does not currently own shares of 
Walnut Corporation. French has told Singh that he believes that Walnut shares 
will experience a large move in price after the upcoming quarterly earnings 
release in two weeks. French also tells Singh, however, that he is unsure which di -

rection the stock will move. French asks Singh to recommend an option strategy 
that would allow him to profit should the share price move in either direction. 
A third client, Wanda Tills, does not currently own Walnut shares and has asked 
Singh to explain the profit potential of three strategies using options in Walnut: 
a long straddle, a bull call spread, and a bear put spread. In addition, Tills asks 
Singh to explain the gamma of a call option. In response, Singh prepares a memo 
to be shared with Tills that provides a discussion of gamma and presents his anal -

The following information relates to questions 
17-23
Anneke Ngoc is an analyst who works for an international bank, where she advis -
es high-net-worth clients on option strategies. Ngoc prepares for a meeting with 
a US-based client, Mani Ahlim.
Ngoc notes that Ahlim recently inherited an account containing a large Brazil -
ian real (BRL) cash balance. Ahlim intends to use the inherited funds to pur -
chase a vacation home in the United States with an expected purchase price of 
US$750,000 in six months. Ahlim is concerned that the Brazilian real will weaken 
against the US dollar over the next six months. Ngoc considers potential hedge 
strategies to reduce the risk of a possible adverse currency movement over this 
time period. 
Ahlim holds shares of Pselftarô Ltd. (PSÔL), which has a current share price of 
$37.41. Ahlim is bullish on PSÔL in the long term. He would like to add to his 
long position but is concerned about a moderate price decline after the quarterly 
earnings announcement next month, in April. Ngoc recommends a protective 
put position with a strike price of $35 using May options and a $40/$50 bull call 
spread using December options. Ngoc gathers selected PSÔL option prices for 
May and December, which are presented in Exhibit 1.

Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 78
SOLUTIONS
1. C is correct. To construct a synthetic long put position, Nuñes would buy a call 
option on IZD. Of course, she would also need to sell (short) IZD shares to com -
plete the synthetic long put position.
2. A is correct. Strategy 2 is a covered call, which is a combination of a long position 
in shares and a short call option. The breakeven point of Strategy 2 is €91.26, 
which representsthe price per share of €93.93 minus the call premium received of 
€2.67 per share ( S0 – c0). So, at any share price less than €91.26 at option expi -
ration, Strategy 2 incurs a loss. If the share price of IZD at option expiration is 
greater than €91.26, Strategy 2 generates a gain.
3. A is correct. Strategy 3 is a covered call strategy, which is a combination of a long 
position in shares and a short call option. The breakeven share price for a covered 
call is the share price minus the call premium received, or S0 – c0. The current 
share price of IZD is €93.93, and the IZD April €97.50 call premium is €1.68. 
Thus, the breakeven underlying share price for Strategy 3 is  S0 – c0 = €93.93 – 
€1.68 = €92.25.
4. B is correct. Strategy 4 is a protective put position, which is a combination of a 
long position in shares and a long put option. By purchasing the €25.00 strike put 
option, Nuñes would be protected from losses at QWY share prices of €25.00 or 
lower. Thus, the maximum loss per share from Strategy 4 would be the loss of 
share value from €28.49 to €25.00 (or €3.49) plus the put premium paid for the 
put option of €0.50: S0 – X + p0 = €28.49 – €25.00 + €0.50 = €3.99.
5. A is correct. Strategy 5 describes a collar, which is a combination of a long posi -
tion in shares, a long put option with an exercise price below the current stock 
price, and a short call option with an exercise price above the current stock price.
6. B is correct. Strategy 5 describes a collar, which is a combination of a long posi -
tion in shares, a long put option, and a short call option. Strategy 5 would require 
Nuñes to buy 100 QWY shares at the current market price of €28.49 per share. 
In addition, she would purchase a QWY April €24.00 strike put option contract 
for €0.35 per share and collect €0.32 per share from writing a QWY April €31.00 
strike call option. The collar offers protection against losses on the shares below 
the put strike price of €24.00 per share, but it also limits upside to the call strike 
price of €31.00 per share. Thus, the maximum gain on the trade, which occurs at 
prices of €31.00 per share or higher, is calculated as ( X2 – S0) – p0 + c0, or (€31.00 
– €28.49) – €0.35 + €0.32 = €2.48 per share.
7. B is correct. Strategy 6 is a bear spread, which is a combination of a long put 
option and a short put option on the same underlying, where the long put has a 
higher strike price than the short put. In the case of Strategy 6, the April €31.00 
put option would be purchased and the April €25.00 put option would be sold. 
The long put premium is €3.00 and the short put premium is €0.50, for a net 
cost of €2.50. The breakeven share price is €28.50, calculated as XH – (pH – pL) = 
€31.00 – (€3.00 – €0.50) = €28.50.
8. B is correct. Strategy 7 describes a short straddle, which is a combination of a 
short put option and a short call option, both with the same strike price. The 
maximum gain is €5.76 per share, which represents the sum of the two option 
premiums, or c0 + p0 = €2.54 + €3.22 = €5.76. The maximum gain per share is 
realized if both options expire worthless, which would happen if the share price 
Solutions 79
of XDF at expiration is €75.00.
9. C is correct. Nuñes would implement Strategy 8, which is a long calendar spread, 
if she expects the XDF share price to increase between the February and Decem -
ber expiration dates. This strategy provides a benefit from the February short 
call premium to partially offset the cost of the December long call option. Nuñes 
likely expects the XDF share price to remain relatively flat between the current 
price €74.98 and €80 until the February call option expires, after which time she 
expects the share price to increase above €80. If such expectations come to frui -
tion, the February call would expire worthless and Nuñes would realize gains on 
the December call option.
10. C is correct. Nuñes should recommend a long straddle, which is a combination 
of a long call option and a long put option, both with the same strike price. The 
committee’s announcement is expected to cause a significant move in XDF’s 
share price. A long straddle is appropriate because the share price is expected to 
move sharply up or down depending on the committee’s decision. If the merger 
is approved, the share price will likely increase, leading to a gain in the long call 
option. If the merger is rejected, then the share price will likely decrease, leading 
to a gain in the long put option.
11. C is correct. A protective put accomplishes Hopewell’s goal of short-term price 
protection. A protective put provides downside protection while retaining the 
upside potential. Although Hopewell is concerned about the downside in the 
short term, he wants to remain invested in Walnut shares because he is positive 
on the stock in the long term. 
12. A is correct. The long straddle strategy is based on expectations of volatility 
in the underlying stock being higher than the market consensus. The straddle 
strategy consists of simultaneously buying a call option and a put option at the 
same strike price. Singh could recommend that French buy a straddle using near 
at-the-money options ($67.50 strike). This allows French to profit should the 
Walnut stock price experience a large move in either direction after the earnings 
release.
13. A is correct. The straddle strategy consists of simultaneously buying a call option 
and buying a put option at the same strike price. The market price for the $67.50 
call option is $1.99, and the market price for the $67.50 put option is $2.26, for 
an initial net cost of $4.25 per share. Thus, this straddle position requires a move 
greater than $4.25 in either direction from the strike price of $67.50 to become 
profitable. So, the straddle becomes profitable at $67.50 – $4.26 = $63.24 or 
lower, or $67.50 + $4.26 = $71.76 or higher. At $63.00, the profit on the straddle is 
positive.
14. A is correct. The bull call strategy consists of buying the lower-strike option and 
selling the higher-strike option. The purchase of the $65 strike call option costs 
$3.65 per share, and selling the $70 strike call option generates an inflow of $0.91 
per share, for an initial net cost of $2.74 per share. At expiration, the maximum 
profit occurs when the stock price is $70 or higher, which yields a $5.00 per 
share payoff ($70 – $65) on the long call position. After deduction of the $2.74 
per share cost required to initiate the bull call spread, the profit is $2.26 ($5.00 
– $2.74).
15. B is correct. The bear put spread consists of buying a put option with a high 
strike price ($70) and selling another put option with a lower strike price ($65). 
The market price for the $70 strike put option is $3.70, and the market price for 
the $65 strike put option is $1.34 per share. Thus, the initial net cost of the bear 
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 80
spread position is $3.70 – $1.34 = $2.36 per share. If Walnut shares are $66 at 
expiration, the $70 strike put option is in the money by $4.00, and the short po -
sition in the $65 strike put expires worthless. After deducting the cost of $2.36 to 
initiate the bear spread position, the net profit is $1.64 per contract.
16. B is correct. The $67.50 call option is approximately at the money because the 
Walnut share price is currently $67.79. Gamma measures the sensitivity of an 
option’s delta to a change in the underlying. The largest gamma occurs when op -
tions are trading at the money or near expiration, when the deltas of such options 
move quickly toward 1.0 or 0.0. Under these conditions, the gammas tend to be 
largest and delta hedges are hardest to maintain. 
17. B is correct. Ahlim could mitigate the risk of the Brazilian real weakening against 
the US dollar over the next six months by (1) purchasing an at-the-money 
six-month BRL/USD call option (to buy US dollars), (2) purchasing an 
at-the-money six-month USD/BRL put option (to sell Brazilian reals), or (3) tak -
ing a long position in a six-month BRL/USD futures contract (to buy US dollars).
Purchasing an at-the-money six-month USD/BRL put option (to sell Brazilian 
reals) would mitigate the risk of a weakening Brazilian real. If the Brazilian real 
should weaken against the US dollar over the next six months, Ahlim could exer -
cise the put option and sell his Brazilian reals at the contract’s strike rate (which 
would have been the prevailing market exchange rate at the time of purchase, 
since the option is at the money).
A is incorrect because purchasing (not selling) an at-the-money six-month BRL/
USD call option (to buy US dollars) would mitigate the risk of the Brazilian real 
weakening against the US dollar over the next six months. The long call position 
would give Ahlim the right to buy US dollars (and sell Brazilian reals). A call on 
US dollars is similar to a put on Brazilian reals. So, a put to sell Brazilian reals at a 
given strike rate can be viewed as a call to buy US dollars.
C is incorrect because going long (not short) a six-month BRL/USD futures 
contract (to buy US dollars) would mitigate the risk of the Brazilian real weaken -
ing against the US dollar over the next six months. A long futures position would 
obligate Ahlim to buy US dollars (and sell Brazilian reals) at the futures contract 
rate. 
18. C is correct. Ngoc recommends a protective put position with a strike price of 
$35 using May options. The maximum loss per share on the protective put is 
calculated as
 Maximum loss per share of protective put = S0 − X + p0.
 Maximum loss per share of protective put = $37.41 − $35.00 + $1.81 = $4.22.
In summary, with the protective put in place, Ahlim is protected against losses 
below $35.00. Thus, taking into account the put option purchase price of $1.81, 
Ahlim’s maximum loss occurs at the share price of $33.19, resulting in a maxi -
mum loss of $4.22 per share (= $37.41 – $33.19).
A is incorrect because $0.60 reflects incorrectly subtracting (rather than adding) 
the put premium in the calculation of the maximum loss of protective put (i.e., 
$37.41 − $35.00 − $1.81 = $0.60).
B is incorrect because $2.41 does not include the put premium in the calculation 
but only reflects the difference between the current share price ($37.41) and the 
put exercise price ($35.00).
19. C is correct. Ngoc recommends a protective put position with a strike price of 
$35 using May options. The breakeven price per share on the protective put is 
Solutions 81
calculated as
 Breakeven price per share of protective put = S0 + p0.
 Breakeven price per share of protective put = $37.41 + $1.81 = $39.22.
In summary, Ahlim would need PSÔL’s share price to rise by the price of the 
put option ($1.81) from the current price of $37.41 to reach the breakeven share 
price—the price at which the gain from the increase in the value of the stock 
offsets the purchase price of the put option.
A is incorrect because $35.60 represents incorrectly subtracting (rather than 
adding) the put premium in the calculation of the protective put breakeven price: 
$37.41 − $1.81 = $35.60.
B is incorrect because $36.81 represents incorrectly adding the put premium to 
the strike price (not the current share price): $35.00 + $1.81 = $36.81.
20. B is correct. Ngoc recommends a $40/$50 bull call spread using December 
options. To construct this spread, Ahlim would buy the $40 call, paying the $6.50 
premium, and simultaneously sell the $50 call, receiving a premium of $4.25. The 
maximum gain or profit of a bull call spread occurs when the stock price reaches 
the high exercise price ($50) or higher at expiration. Thus, the maximum profit 
per share of a bull call spread is the spread difference between the strike prices 
less the net premium paid, calculated as
 Maximum profit per share of bull call spread = ( XH – XL) – (cL – cH).
 Maximum profit per share of bull call spread = ($50 – $40) – ($6.50 – $4.25).
 Maximum profit per share of bull call spread = $7.75.
A is incorrect because $2.25 represents only the net premium and does not in -
clude the spread difference.
C is incorrect because $12.25 represents the net premium being incorrectly add -
ed (rather than subtracted) from the spread difference.
21. A is correct. Ngoc recommends a $40/$50 bull call spread using December 
options. To construct this spread, Ahlim would buy the $40 call, paying a $6.50 
premium, and simultaneously sell the $50 call, receiving a $4.25 premium. The 
breakeven price per share of a bull call spread is calculated as
 Breakeven price per share of bull call spread = XL + (cL – cH).
 Breakeven price per share of bull call spread = $40 + ($6.50 – $4.25).
 Breakeven price per share of bull call spread = $42.25.
In summary, in order to break even, the PSÔL stock price must rise above $40 
by the amount of the net premium paid of $2.25 to enter into the bull call spread. 
At the price of $42.25, the lower $40 call option would have an exercise value of 
$2.25, exactly offsetting the $2.25 cost of entering the trade.
B is incorrect because $47.75 represents the net premium being incorrectly sub -
tracted from the high exercise price (rather than being added to the low exercise 
price): $50 – ($6.50 – $4.25) = $47.75.
C is incorrect because $52.25 represents the net premium being added to the 
high exercise price (rather than the low exercise price): $50 + ($6.50 – $4.25) = 
$52.25.
22. B is correct. When the implied volatility decreases for OTM (out-of-the-money) 
calls relative to ATM (at-the-money) calls and increases for OTM puts relative 
Learning Module 1 Options Strategies 82
to ATM puts, a volatility skew exists. Put volatility is higher, rising from 16.44 
ATM to 17.72 OTM, likely because of the higher demand for puts to hedge posi -
tions in the index against downside risk. Call volatility decreases from 12.26 for 
ATM calls to 11.98 for OTM calls since calls do not offer this valuable portfolio 
insurance.
A is incorrect because a risk reversal is a delta-hedged trading strategy seeking to 
profit from a change in the relative volatility of calls and puts.
C is incorrect because a volatility smile exists when both call and put volatilities, 
not just put volatilities, are higher OTM than ATM.
23. A is correct. The research report concludes that the consensus forecast of the im -
plied volatility of index options is too low and anticipates greater-than-expected 
volatility over the next month. Given the neutral market direction forecast, Ngoc 
should recommend a long straddle, which entails buying a one-month 11,600 call 
and buying a one-month put with the same exercise price. If the future NIFTY 50 
Index level rises above its current level plus the combined cost of the call and put 
premiums, Ahlim would exercise the call option and realize a profit. Similarly, if 
the index level falls below the current index level minus the combined cost of the 
call and put premiums, Ahlim would exercise the put option and realize a profit. 
Thus, Ahlim profits if the index moves either up or down enough to pay for the 
call and put premiums.
B is incorrect because the strategy to buy a call option would be reasonable given 
an increase in expected implied volatility with a bullish NIFTY 50 Index forecast, 
not a neutral trading range. 
C is incorrect because a long calendar spread is based on the expectation that 
implied volatility will remain unchanged, not increase, until the expiry of the 
shorter-term option.

return trade-offs. Therefore, the purpose of this reading is to illustrate ways in which 
these derivatives might be used in typical investment situations. Sections 2–4 of 
this reading show how swaps, forwards, and futures can be used to modify the risk 
exposure of an existing position. Sections 5–6 provide a discussion on derivatives on 
volatility. Sections 7–9 demonstrate a series of applications showing ways in which

Changing Risk Exposures with Swaps, Futures, and Forwards
Financial managers can use swaps, forwards, and futures markets to quickly and 
efficiently alter the underlying risk exposure of their asset portfolios or anticipated 
investment transactions. This section covers a variety of common examples that use 
swaps, futures, and forwards.
Managing Interest Rate Risk
Interest Rate Swaps
An interest rate swap is an over-the-counter (OTC) contract between two parties that 
agree to exchange cash flows on specified payment dates—one based on a variable  
(floating) interest rate and the other based on a fixed  rate (the “swap rate”)—determined 
at the time the swap is initiated. The swap tenor is when the swap is agreed to expire. 
Both interest rates are applied to the swap’s notional value to determine the size of 
each payment. Normally, the resulting two payments (one fixed, one floating) are in 
the same currency but will not be equal, so they are typically netted, with the party 
owing the greater amount paying the difference to the other party. In this manner, 
a party that currently has a fixed (floating) risk or other obligation can effectively 
convert it into a floating (fixed) one.
Interest rate swaps are among the most widely used instruments to manage inter -
est rate risk. In particular, they are designed to manage the risk on cash flows arising 
from investors’ assets and liabilities. Interest rate swaps and futures can also be used 
to modify the risk and return profile of a portfolio. This is associated with managing a 
portfolio of bonds that generally involves controlling the portfolio’s duration. Although 
futures are commonly used to make duration changes, swaps can also be used, and 
we shall see how in this reading. Finally, interest rate swaps are used by financial 
institutions to hedge the interest rate risk exposure deriving from the issuance of 
financial instruments sold to clients. Example 1  shows how an interest rate swap is 
used to convert floating-rate securities into fixed-rate securities. Here the firm initially 
expects continuing low interest rates, so it issues floating-rate bonds. But after con -
cluding that rates are likely to increase, the firm seeks to convert its interest rate risk 
to a fixed obligation, even though doing so means making higher payments up front.
Managing Interest Rate Risk with Swaps 85
EXAMPLE 1
Using an Interest Rate Swap to Convert Floating-Rate 
Securities into Fixed-Rate Securities
An investment firm has sold £20 million of three-year floating-rate bonds that 
pay a semiannual coupon equal to the six-month market reference rate plus 50 
bps. A few days later, the firm’s outlook changes substantially, and it now expects 
higher rates in the future. The firm enters into an interest rate swap with a tenor 
of approximately three years and semiannual payments, where the firm pays a 
fixed par swap rate of 1.25% and receives the six-month reference rate. The swap 
settlement dates are the same as the coupon payment dates on the floating-rate 
bonds. At the first swap settlement date, the six-month reference rate is 0.75%.
Analysis:
At the first coupon payment and swap settlement date, the six-month reference 
rate is 0.75% (annualized). This means that on the swap the investment firm will 
make a net payment of £50,000 as follows:
 ■Receive based on the reference rate: 0.75% × £20 million × (180/360) = 
£75,000.
 ■Pay based on the fixed rate: 1.25% × £20 million × (180/360) = 
£125,000.
 ■Net payment made  by the firm to swap dealer: £125,000 − £75,000 = 
£50,000.
Firm
BondholdersSwap Dealer £50,000
£125,000
At the same time, the first semiannual coupon payment on the securities 
will be (0.75% + 0.50%) × £20 million × (180/360) = £125,000.
The total payment made by the investment firm on the securities and the 
swap is £175,000 (= £125,000 + £50,000).
Now assume that as we move forward to the second coupon payment and 
swap settlement date, interest rates have increased and the six-month reference 
rate is 1.50%.
On the swap, the investment firm will receive a net payment of £25,000 as 
follows:
 ■Receive based on the new reference rate: 1.50% × £20 million × 
(180/360) = £150,000.
 ■Pay based on the fixed rate: 1.25% × £20 million × (180/360) = 
£125,000.
 ■Net payment received  by the firm: £150,000 − £125,000 = £25,000.
The coupon payment on the securities will be (1.50% + 0.50%) × £20 million 
× (180/360) = £200,000.
The total payment made by the investment firm on the securities and the 
swap is again £175,000 (= £200,000 − £25,000).

The investment firm has effectively fixed its all-in borrowing costs. Since 
this fixed cost is synthesized by a combination of the underlying debt position 
and the derivative contract, it can be described as a synthetic fixed security.
Why should the investment firm decide to pay a fixed rate of 1.25%, on a semiannual 
basis, for the remaining life of the securities when the reference rate is only 0.75% today? 
The reason is that the firm’s outlook is now for higher rates in the future, as expressed 
by market participants in the upward-sloping yield curve. An upward-sloping yield 
curve reflects that investors require higher risk premium compensation for holding 
longer-term securities.
The agreed-on fixed rate on the swap is based on the term structure of rates at 
the time the deal is initiated. If the term structure changes, the new fixed rate agreed 
on by the counterparties on a swap with the same residual time to maturity as the 
original one will be different from the original rate. This means that the market value 
of the swap will become positive or negative. In particular, the investment firm in 
Example 1  has managed to fix the interest rate on future payments but has given away 
the opportunity to benefit from possible lower interest rates in the future. If the term 
structure of interest rates has a parallel shift downward, meaning that all rates across 
tenors decrease, the value of the swap will become negative from the perspective of 
the fixed-rate payer, depending on the new swap market fixed rate. The investment 
firm has managed to achieve the desired fixed profile of future cash flows, but it 
might incur a loss if the firm wants to unwind the interest rate swap before maturity. 
Alternatively, if rates rise, as now expected, the swap can be unwound at a profit by the 
same reasoning in reverse: The value of the swap becomes positive from the fixed-rate 
payer’s view; fixed-rate payment paid is less than floating-rate payment received.
This explanation introduces the concepts of marking to market of the swap and 
how swaps can be used in fixed-income portfolio management with the objective to 
hedge the changes in value of a portfolio with fixed cash flows.
When a bond portfolio is fully hedged, its value is immunized with respect to 
changes in yields. This can be stated as Δ P = (Ns)(ΔS), where Δ P is the change in the 
value of the bond portfolio and ΔS is the change in the value of the swap for a given 
change in interest rates. The notional principal of the swap ( Ns) will be determined 
as Ns = Δ P/ΔS. To reduce changes in value of a fixed-rate portfolio, the manager will 
want to lower the overall duration by exchanging part of this fixed-rate income stream 
for a floating-rate stream. This can be done by entering an interest rate swap where 
the portfolio manager will pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate.
It is important to keep in mind that most of the time, the hedging instrument and 
the asset or portfolio to be hedged are imperfect substitutes. The result is a market 
risk, called basis risk  or spread risk —the difference between the market performance 
of the asset and the derivative instrument used to hedge it. When using an interest 
rate swap to hedge, it is possible that the changes in the underlying rate of the deriv -
ative contract, and thus in the value of the swap, do not perfectly mirror changes in 
the value of the bond portfolio.
Furthermore, the composition of the bond portfolio could bear additional market 
risks other than interest rate risk. For instance, suppose a portfolio of corporate bonds 
is hedged with an interest rate swap. In this case, even if interest rate risk is hedged, 
the investor is still exposed to credit spread risk.
The main underlying assumptions we will use are that the change in value of the 
bond portfolio can be approximated by using the concept of modified duration,1 the 
yield curve is flat, and it is affected only by parallel shifts. Furthermore, we assume 
here that the portfolio and the derivative contract used to hedge are perfect substitutes.
1 Although there are various duration measures, we are concerned here with modified duration, which is 
an approximate measure of how a bond price changes given a small change in the level of interest rates.
Managing Interest Rate Risk with Swaps 87
A measure for the change in the value of the bond portfolio (Δ P) for a change in 
interest rates is given by the portfolio’s modified duration, MDURP. The same mea -
sure calculated for the interest rate swap, MDURS, is used to determine the change 
in the value of the swap, Δ S. The target modified duration for the combined portfolio 
is MDURT, and MVP is the market value of the bond portfolio.
By properly choosing the notional value and the tenor of the swap, the portfolio 
manager can achieve a combination of the existing portfolio and the interest rate swap 
that sets the overall portfolio duration to the target duration: ( MVP)(MDURP) + (NS)
(MDURS) = ( MVP)(MDURT).
The equivalence Δ P = (NS)(ΔS) becomes ( MVP)(MDURT − MDURP) = ( NS)
(MDURS). To find the swap notional principal, NS, we need to solve for the following 
formula:
   N  S   =    (    MDU  R  T   − MDU  R  P    ______________  MDU  R  S     )       (  M  V  P   )      (1)
The modified duration of a swap ( MDURS) is the net of the modified durations of 
the equivalent positions in fixed- and floating-rate bonds. Thus, the position of the 
pay-fixed party in a pay-fixed, receive-floating swap has the modified duration of 
a floating-rate bond minus the modified duration of a fixed-rate bond, where the 
floating- and fixed-rate bonds have cash flows equivalent to the corresponding cash 
flows of the swap. A pay-fixed, receive-floating swap has a negative (positive) dura -
tion from the perspective of a fixed-rate payer (receiver), because the duration of a 
fixed-rate bond is positive and larger than the duration of a floating-rate bond, which 
is near zero. Moreover, the negative duration of this position to the fixed-rate payer/
floating-rate receiver makes sense in that the position would be expected to benefit 
from rising interest rates.
EXAMPLE 2
Using an Interest Rate Swap to Achieve a Target Duration
1. Consider a portfolio manager with an investment portfolio of €50 million of 
fixed-rate German bonds with an average modified duration of 5.5. Because 
he fears that interest rates will rise, he wants to reduce the modified dura -
tion of the portfolio to 4.5, but he does not want to sell any of the securities. 
One way to do this would be to add a negative-duration position by entering 
into an interest rate swap where he pays the fixed rate and receives the float -
ing rate. A two-year interest rate swap has an estimated modified duration 
of −2.00 from the perspective of the fixed-rate payer.
Demonstrate how the manager can use this interest rate swap to achieve the 
target modified duration.
Solution:
The portfolio manager’s goal is for the bonds and the swap to combine to 
create a portfolio with a market value of €50 million and a target modified 
duration of 4.5. This relationship can be expressed as follows:
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 88
 €50,000,000(5.50) + ( NS)(MDURS) = €50,000,000(4.50),
where
NS = Interest rate swap’s notional principal
MDURS = Interest rate swap’s modified duration, set equal to −2.00
So, the notional principal of this interest rate swap that the manager should 
use is determined using Equation 1, as follows:
 NS = [(4.50 − 5.50)/(−2.00)] × €50,000,000 = €25,000,000.
MANAGING INTEREST RATE RISK WITH FORWARDS 
AND FUTURES
demonstrate how interest rate swaps, forwards, and futures can be 
used to modify a portfolio’s risk and return
The market in short-term interest rate derivatives is large and liquid, and the instru -
ments involved are forward rate agreements (FRAs) and interest rate futures. A forward 
rate agreement is an OTC derivative instrument that is used mainly to hedge a loan 
expected to be taken out in the near future or to hedge against changes in the level 
of interest rates in the future. In fact, with advanced settled at maturity, an FRA will 
settle only the discounted difference between the interest rate agreed on in the con -
tract and the actual rate prevailing at the time of settlement, applied on the notional 
amount of the contract. In general, managing short-term interest rate risk with an 
interest rate forward contract can also be done with an interest rate futures contract. 
Forwards, like swaps, are OTC instruments and are especially useful because they 
can be customized, but they do have counterparty risk. In contrast, exchange-traded 
interest rate futures contracts are standardized and guaranteed by a clearinghouse, 
so counterparty risk is virtually zero.2
Forward rate agreements and interest rate futures are widely used to hedge the risk 
associated with interest rates changing from the time a loan or a deposit is anticipated 
until it is actually implemented. Example 3  demonstrates how interest rate futures are 
used to lock in an interest rate.
EXAMPLE 3
Using Interest Rate Futures to Lock in an Interest Rate
Amanda Wright, the chief investment officer (CIO) of a US-based philanthropic 
foundation is expecting a donation of $30 million in two months’ time from a 
member of the foundation’s founding family. This significant donation will then 
be invested for three months and subsequently will be divided into smaller grants 
2 Regulatory changes in global markets are moving both over-the-counter swaps and forward contracts 
toward a clearing process as well. The clearing process reduces the risk that one counterparty will default 
on its obligations (by requiring collateral for trades and by daily marking to market of open positions), and 
for this reason, the counterparty risk associated with each single trade is virtually zero. However, there is 
still the risk that a major counterparty will fail to carry out its obligations (e.g., Lehman Brothers), causing 
operational risks for investors.2
Managing Interest Rate Risk with Forwards and Futures 89
to be made to medical and educational institutions supported by the founda -
tion. The current (i.e., spot) three-month reference rate is 2.40% (annualized). 
The CIO expects interest rates to fall, and she decides to hedge the rate on the 
deposit with Eurodollar futures.
To provide background information, Eurodollar futures are cash settled on 
the basis of the market reference rate for an offshore deposit having a principal 
value of $1 million and a three-month maturity. These contracts are quoted in 
terms of the “IMM index”3 that is equal to 100 less the annualized yield on the 
security. A 1 bp (0.01% or 0.0001) change in the value of the futures contract 
equates to a $25.00 movement in the contract value. Thus, the basis point value 
(BPV) of a $1 million face value, 90-day money market instrument is given by
  BPV = Face value  ×    (    Days _ 360   )     × 0.01 %  = $1, 000, 000 ×    (    90 _ 360   )     × 0.01 %  
 = $25 
Analysis:
Wright buys 30 of the Eurodollar futures contracts at 97.60, locking in a forward 
rate of 2.40%. After two months, the donation is received and the CIO initiates the 
deposit at the then-lower spot rate of 2.10%. She unwinds the hedge at a futures 
price of 97.90, which is 30 bps higher than where the position was initiated.
The foundation will receive $180,000 from the deposit plus the hedge, as 
follows:
1. Interest obtained on the deposit: 2.10% × $30 million × (90/360) = 
$157,500.
2. Profit on the hedge is 30 bps (30 × $25 = $750), which for 30 contracts 
corresponds to $22,500 (= $750 × 30).
This corresponds to the return on an investment at the initial three-month 
reference rate of 2.40%, or 2.40% × $30 million × (90/360) = $180,000. This cal -
culation demonstrates that by buying the Eurodollar futures, Wright did indeed 
lock in a forward rate of 2.40%.
Institutional investors and bond traders can decide to use interest rate futures or 
fixed-income futures (also referred to as “bond futures”) contracts, which are longer 
dated, to hedge interest rate risk exposure. The choice will depend on the maturity of 
the bond or portfolio to be hedged. Since they are listed, interest rate futures have a 
limited number of maturities. Furthermore, the nearest months’ contracts have higher 
liquidity than the longer tenors. For these reasons, interest rate futures (e.g., Eurodollar 
futures) are commonly used to hedge short-term bonds, with up to two to three years 
remaining to maturity. When using interest rate futures to hedge a short-term bond, 
an effective and widely adopted technique to construct the hedge is to use a strip of 
futures contracts. Having measured the responsiveness of the bond to an interest rate 
change, it is now necessary to measure the sensitivity of each cash flow to changes 
in the relevant forward rate. Then, one can calculate the number of futures contracts 
needed to hedge the interest rate exposure for each cash flow. Fixed-income futures 
contracts remain, however, the preferred instrument to hedge bond positions, given 
that their liquidity is very high. This is especially true for US Treasury bond futures.

The distinction is seldom made today because CME operates as a unified entity, but references to IMM 
persist today.
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 90
Fixed-Income Futures
Portfolio managers that want to hedge the duration risk of their bond portfolios usu -
ally use fixed-income futures. They are standardized forward contracts listed on an 
exchange that have as underlying a basket of deliverable bonds with remaining matur -
ities within a predefined range. The most liquid contracts include T-note and T-bond 
futures listed on the Chicago Board of Trade or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
Contracts expire in March, June, September, and December, and the underlying assets 
include Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. In Europe, the most liquid and most heavily 
traded fixed-income futures are traded on the Eurex, and these are the Euro-Bund 
(FGBL), Euro-Bobl (FGBM), and Euro-Schatz (FCBS).4 These futures contracts have 
German federal government–issued bonds with different maturities as underlying. The 
Schatz is also known as the short bund futures contract because the maturities of the 
underlying bonds range from 21 to 27 months. In contrast, maturities of underlying 
bonds range from 4.5 years to 5.5 years for the Bobl futures contract and are even 
longer (between 10 years and 30 years) for the Bund futures contract.
Bond futures are used by hedgers to protect an existing bond portfolio against 
adverse interest rate movements and by arbitrageurs to gain from price differences 
in equivalent instruments.
A fixed-income futures contract has as its underlying reference assets a basket of 
deliverable bonds with a range of different coupon levels and maturity dates. Most 
futures contracts are closed before delivery or rolled into the next contract month. 
However, in the case of delivery, the futures contract seller has the obligation to deliver 
and the right to choose which security to deliver. For this reason, the duration of a 
futures contract is usually consistent with the forward behavior of the cheapest under -
lying deliverable bond. This is called the cheapest-to-deliver (CTD) bond, the eligible 
bond that the seller will most likely choose to deliver under the futures contract if he 
decides to deliver (rather than close out the futures position). The price sensitivity of 
the bond futures will, therefore, reflect the duration of the CTD bond.
Within the underlying basket of bonds, the seller will deliver the CTD bond, the 
one that presents the greatest profit or smallest loss at delivery. To provide a guide for 
choosing the CTD bond, the concept of the conversion factor (CF) has been introduced. 
Given that the short side has the option of delivering any eligible security, a conversion 
factor invoicing system that allows for a less biased comparison in choosing among 
deliverable bonds has been established. In fact, the amount the futures contract seller 
receives at delivery will depend on the conversion factor that, when multiplied by the 
futures settlement price, will generate a price at which the deliverable bond would 
trade if its coupon were the notional coupon of the futures contract specification 
(e.g., 6% coupon and 20 years to maturity). The principal invoice amount at maturity 
is given in the following equation:5
 Principal invoice amount 
 =  
(Futures settlement price/100) × CF × Contract size.  
 (2)
4 “Bobl” comes from the German term “Bundesobligation, ” which corresponds to a federal government 
bond. “Schatz” is the English word for “Bundesschatzanweisungen, ” or “Schätze, ” which is two-year debt 
issued by the German federal government, whereas “Bunds” represent long-term obligations.
5 If there is accrued interest due on the CTD bond, the futures contract seller will receive the following 
at delivery: Total invoice amount = Principal invoice amount + Accrued interest.
Managing Interest Rate Risk with Forwards and Futures 91
The cheapest-to-deliver bond is determined on the basis of duration, relative bond 
prices, and yield levels. In particular, a bond with a low (high) coupon rate, a long 
(short) maturity, and thus a long (short) duration will most likely be the CTD bond 
if the market yield is above (below) the notional yield of the fixed-income futures 
contract. The notional yield is usually in line with the prevailing interest rate.
The pricing discrepancy between the price of the cash security and that of the 
fixed-income futures is the basis. It is determined by the spot cash price less the futures 
price multiplied by the conversion factor. The possibility of physical delivery of the 
underlying asset guarantees convergence of futures and spot prices on the delivery 
date. In fact, the no-arbitrage condition requires the basis to be zero on the delivery 
date; otherwise, substantial arbitrage profits can be made. However, basis traders 
look for arbitrage opportunities by capitalizing on relatively small pricing differences. 
If the basis is negative, a trader would make a profit by “buying the basis”—that is, 
purchasing the bond and shorting the futures. In contrast, the trader would make a 
profit by “selling the basis” when the basis is positive; in this case, she would sell the 
bond and buy the futures. Example 4  demonstrates how to determine the CTD bond 
for delivery under a Treasury bond futures contract.
EXAMPLE 4
Delivery on a Fixed-Income Futures Contract
A trader has sold 10-year US Treasury bond futures contracts expiring in June 
and now has the obligation to deliver and the right to choose which security to 
deliver (the CTD bond). The futures contract reference security is a US Treasury 
bond with 20 years to maturity and a coupon of 6%. The T-bond futures con -
tract size is $100,000. The futures contract settlement price is $143.47. The 
trader now needs to determine which of the two bonds in the following table 
is cheapest to deliver.
 
  Bond A Bond B
Cash Bond T 4½ 02/15/36 T 5 05/15/37
Cash Dirty Price $120.75 $128.50
Bond Purchase Value $120,750 $128,500
Futures Settlement Price 143.47 143.47
Conversion Factor 0.8388 0.8883
Contract Size $100,000 $100,000
Principal Invoice Amount $120,342.64 $127,444.40
Delivery Gain/Loss −$407.36 = $120,342.64 − $120,750 −$1,055.60 = $127,444.40 − $128,500
 
Analysis:
The trader will try to maximize the difference between the amount received 
upon delivery, given by the futures contract settlement price (divided by 100) 
times the conversion factor times $100,000, and the cost of acquiring the bond 
for delivery, given by its market price plus any accrued interest (i.e., the dirty 
price). Note that this example assumes no accrued interest.
The conversion factors for both bonds are less than 1 since both bonds have 
a coupon lower than 6%, the coupon for the futures contract standard. Bond 
A can be purchased for $120,750 and Bond B for $128,500, both per $100,000 
face value. These purchase prices are compared with the amounts received upon 
delivery. Principal invoice amounts are calculated using Equation 2, as follows:
 Principal invoice amount = (Futures settlement price/100) × CF × $100,000.
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 92
 Bond A: 143.47/100 × 0.8388 × $100,000 = $120,342.64.
 Bond B: 143.47/100 × 0.8883 × $100,000 = $127,444.40.
The cheapest to deliver is Bond A, the 4½% T-bond with a maturity date of 
02/15/36, since the loss on delivering Bond A ($407.36) is less than the loss on 
delivering Bond B ($1,055.60).
Continuing with the previous analysis where we hedged a portfolio of fixed-rate 
securities, we now determine the hedge ratio (HR) expressed as the number of 
fixed-income futures contracts to be sold or purchased. The relation Δ P = (HR)(ΔF) 
is still valid; note that we saw it previously in the context of swaps as Δ P = (Ns)(ΔS), 
where Δ P is the change in the value of the bond portfolio and Δ F is the change in 
the value of the fixed-income futures. The “ideal” hedge balances any change in value 
in the cash securities with an equal and opposite-sign change in the futures’ value.
With futures, however, we have to consider the cheapest-to-deliver bond price and 
the conversion factor. Because the basis of the CTD bond is generally closest to zero, 
any change in the futures price level (Δ F) will be a reflection of the change in the value 
of the CTD bond adjusted by its conversion factor. By considering the relative price 
movement of the bond futures contract to the cheapest-to-deliver bond, we have Δ F = 
ΔCTD /CF. By substituting into the equation Δ P = (HR)(ΔF), the hedge ratio becomes
  HR =   ΔP _ ΔCTD     (  CF )      (3)
In the case where the bond to hedge is the CTD, then a hedge ratio based on the 
conversion factor is likely to be quite effective (given that the price of a fixed-income 
futures contract tends to track closely with that of the cheapest-to-deliver bond).
However, for other securities with different coupons and maturities, the number 
of bond futures that are used to hedge against price changes of a fixed-rate bond is 
calculated on the basis of a duration-based hedge ratio. Moreover, the relationship 
between the bond’s price and its yield can also be stated in terms of basis point value 
and the portfolio’s target modified duration, MDURT, such that the portfolio’s target 
basis point value ( BPVT) is
 BPVT = MDURT × 0.01% × MVP (4)
In the special case where the objective is to completely hedge the portfolio, BPVT = 0. 
The effect of the basis point value hedge ratio ( BPVHR ) is then conceptualized as BPVP 
+ BPVHR  × BPVF = 0. Thus, BPVHR  = −BPVP/BPVF, which uses the basis point value 
of the portfolio to be hedged ( BPVP) and that of the futures contract ( BPVF), where
 BPVP = MDURP × 0.01% × MVP (5)
and
 BPVF = BPVCTD/CF (6)
In Equation 6, the numerator is BPVCTD, the basis point value of the cheapest-to-deliver 
bond under the futures contract, and the denominator is CF, its conversion factor. 
The basis point value of the cheapest-to-deliver bond is determined, in a manner 
analogous to Equation 4  and Equation 5 , as
 BPVCTD = MDURCTD × 0.01% × MVCTD (7)
where MVCTD = (CTD price/100) × Futures contract size.
Finally, for small changes in yield, by substituting into the equation BPVHR  
= −BPVP/BPVF, where BPVF becomes BPVCTD/CF, in the special case of complete 
hedging, BPVHR  in terms of number of futures contracts is
  BPVHR =   − BP  V  P   _ BP  V  CTD     × Conversion factor   (8)
Managing Interest Rate Risk with Forwards and Futures 93
EXAMPLE 5
Hedging Bond Holdings with Fixed-Income Futures
A portfolio manager is holding €50 million (principal) in German bunds (DBRs) 
and wants to fully hedge the value of the bond investment against a rise in 
interest rates. The portfolio has a modified duration of 9.50 and a market value 
of €49,531,000. Moreover, the manager wishes to fully hedge the bond portfolio 
(so, BPVT = 0) with a short position in Euro-Bund futures with a price of 158.33. 
The cheapest-to-deliver bond is the DBR 0.25% 02/15/27 that has a price of 
98.14, modified duration of 8.623, and conversion factor of 0.619489. The size 
of the futures contract is €100,000.
Determine the following:
1. The BPVP of the portfolio to be hedged
Solution to 1:
The basis point value of the portfolio ( BPVP), stated in terms of the change 
in value for a 1 bp (0.01%) change in yield, is calculated using Equation 5 , as 
follows:
 BPVP = MDURP × 0.01% × MVP
 
Portfolio Principal €50,000,000
Portfolio Market Value €49,531,000
Modified Duration 9.50
 
 BPVP = 9.50 × 0.0001 × €49,531,000 = €47,054.45.
Thus, the portfolio to be hedged has a BPVP of €47,054.45 per €50 million 
notional.
2. The BPVCTD of the futures contract hedging instrument
Solution to 2:
The basis point value of the CTD bond underlying the futures contract 
(BPVCTD) is calculated using Equation 7, as follows:
 BPVCTD = MDURCTD × 0.01% × MVCTD

So, the BPV of the CTD bond ( BPVCTD) is €84.63.
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 94
3. The number of Euro-Bund futures contracts to sell to fully hedge the 
portfolio
Solution to 3:
Using Equation 8 and the Solutions to 1 and 2, we have:
  BPVHR =   − BP  V  P   _ BP  V  CTD     × CF =   − €47, 054.45 _  €84.63   × 0.619489  = − 344.437  ≈ − 344 
Therefore, the number of Euro-Bund futures to sell to fully hedge the portfo -
lio is 344 contracts.
In the real world, however, the hedging results are imperfect because (1) the hedge 
is done with the cheapest-to-deliver bond, and since the CTD bond can change over 
the holding period, the duration of the futures contract can also change; (2) the rela -
tionship between interest rates and bond prices is not linear, owing to convexity; and 
(3) the term structure of interest rates often changes via non-parallel moves.
Reconsidering Example 2  from before, in which the manager whose portfolio has 
a modified duration of 5.5 years wants to lower the duration to 4.5 years, the general 
principle is the same. What needs to be determined is the number of futures contracts 
that are required to reduce the portfolio’s modified duration to the target level. In this 
more general case, where MDURT (and BPVT) is non-zero, stated in terms of basis 
point value and BPVHR , we have BPVP + BPVHR  × BPVF = BPVT.
Solving for BPVHR  and substituting for BPVF, we have the more general version 
of Equation 8:
   BPVHR =    (    BP  V  T   − BP  V  P    ___________  BP  V  F     )    
    =    (    BP  V  T   − BP  V  P    ___________ BP  V  CTD   / CF   )       
=    (    BP  V  T   − BP  V  P    ___________  BP  V  CTD     )     × CF    (9)
EXAMPLE 6
Decreasing Portfolio Duration with Futures
Consider the portfolio manager from Example 5  who now decides to decrease 
the portfolio’s modified duration from 9.50 to 8.50. The yield curve is flat. 
Additionally, we have already demonstrated that given the portfolio’s market 
value of €49,531,000, the BPVP is €47,054.50. Finally, assume the CTD bond 
underlying the Euro-Bund futures is the same as before, DBR 0.25% 02/15/27, 
with a BPVCTD of €84.63 and a conversion factor of 0.619489.
Determine the following:
1. The BPVT of the portfolio to be hedged
Solution to 1:
Using Equation 4 with a MDURT of 8.50, the portfolio’s target basis point 
value ( BPVT) will be
 BPVT = 8.50 × 0.0001 × €49,531,000 = €42,101.35.
Managing Currency Exposure 95
2. The number of Euro-Bund futures contracts to sell to reduce the portfolio’s 
modified duration to 8.50
Solution to 2:
To achieve the target modified duration of 8.50, the portfolio manager must 
implement a short position in Euro-Bund futures. Using the same cheap -
est-to-deliver bond with a BPVCTD of €84.63 and a conversion factor of 
0.619489, the number of Euro-Bund futures to sell to decrease the portfolio’s 
duration is calculated using Equation 9:
   BPVHR =    (    €42, 101.35  − €47, 054.50  __________________   €84.63   )     × 0.619489      
= − 36.26  ≈ − 36 futures contracts   
Therefore, the number of Euro-Bund futures to sell to achieve the target 
portfolio duration of 8.50 is 36 contracts.
MANAGING CURRENCY EXPOSURE
demonstrate how currency swaps, forwards, and futures can be used 
to modify a portfolio’s risk and return
Currency swaps, forwards, and futures can be used to effectively alter currency risk 
exposures. Currency risk is the risk that the value of a current or future asset (liabil -
ity) in a foreign currency will decrease (increase) when converted into the domestic 
currency.
Currency Swaps
A currency swap is similar to an interest rate swap, but it is different in two ways: (1) 
The interest rates are associated with different currencies, and (2) the notional principal 
amounts may or may not be exchanged at the beginning and end of the swap’s life.6
Currency swaps help the parties in the swap to hedge against the risk of exchange 
rate fluctuations and to achieve better rate outcomes. In particular, a cross-currency 
basis swap  exchanges notional principals because the goal of the transaction is to 
issue at a more favorable funding rate and swap the amount back to the currency of 
choice. Firms that need foreign-denominated cash can obtain the funding in their local 
currency and then swap the local currency for the required foreign currency using a 
cross-currency basis swap. The swap periodically sets interest rate payments, mostly 
floating for floating, separately in two different currencies. The net effect is to use a 
loan in a local currency to take out a loan in a foreign currency while avoiding any 
foreign exchange risk. In fact, the exchange rate is fixed, as illustrated in Example 7 .
6 Although an exchange of notional principals often occurs, the parties may agree not to do this. Some 
types of hedge transactions are designed to hedge only foreign interest cash flows and not principal pay -
ments, so a principal exchange on a currency swap would not be necessary.3
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 96
EXAMPLE 7
Cross-Currency Basis Swap
Consider a Canadian private equity (PE) firm that is executing a leveraged buy -
out (LBO) of a small, struggling US-based electronics manufacturer. The goal 
is to turn around the company by implementing new robotics technology for 
making servers and infrastructure devices for “bitcoin mining. ” Exit from the 
LBO via initial public offering is expected in three years. To execute the LBO 
and provide working capital for US operations, the PE firm needs USD40 million. 
The rate on a US dollar loan is the semiannual US dollar reference floating rate 
plus 100 bps. The PE firm discovers that it can borrow more cheaply in the local 
Canadian market and decides to fund the LBO in Canadian dollars (CAD) by 
borrowing CAD50 million for three years at the semiannual Canadian dollar 
reference floating rate plus 65 bps. Then it contacts a New York–based dealer 
and requests a quote for a three-year cross-currency basis swap with semian -
nual interest payments to exchange the CAD50 million into US dollars. The 
three-year CAD–USD cross-currency basis swap is quoted at −15 bps at a rate 
of USD/CAD 0.8000 (expressed as US dollars per 1 Canadian dollar). The swap 
agreement provides that both parties pay the semiannual reference floating rate, 
but the Canadian dollar rate also includes a “basis. ” Here the basis is the differ -
ence between interest rates in the cross-currency basis swap and those used to 
determine the forward exchange rates. If covered interest rate parity holds, a 
forward exchange rate is determined by the spot exchange rate and the interest 
rate differential between foreign and domestic currencies over the term of the 
forward rate. However, usually covered interest rate parity does not hold and 
thus gives rise to the basis.
The basis is quoted on the non-USD leg of the swap. “Paying” the basis 
would mean borrowing the other currency versus lending US dollars, whereas 
“receiving” the basis implies lending the other currency versus borrowing US 
dollars. The three-year CAD–USD cross-currency swap in this case is quoted 
at −15 bps. This means that the Canadian PE firm, the “lender” of the Canadian 
dollars in the swap, will receive the Canadian dollar reference rate, assumed to 
be 1.95%, minus 15 bps every six months in exchange for paying the US dollar 
reference rate for the US dollars it has “borrowed. ” Given that the PE firm pays 
the Canadian dollar floating rate plus 65 bps on its bank loan, the effective spread 
paid becomes 80 bps (= 65bps + 15 bps). This compares with a spread of 100 
bps if instead it borrowed in US dollars.
Analysis:
We now examine the cash flows in the cross-currency basis swap, where N is 
the notional principal of the Canadian dollar leg of the swap and S0, agreed at 
the start, is the spot exchange rate for all payments (at inception, on interest 
payment dates, and at maturity). For the Canadian PE firm, this means that
 N = CAD50 million and S0= USD/CAD 0.8000.
Flows at the inception of the swap.
At inception, the Canadian PE firm delivers Canadian dollars ( N) in exchange 
for US dollars (at a rate of N × S0).
PE Firm Swap DealerCAD50 million
USD40 million (= CAD50 million × 0.8000 USD/CAD)
Managing Currency Exposure 97
At each payment date, the PE firm makes a floating-rate payment in US 
dollars and receives a floating-rate payment in Canadian dollars that is passed 
on to the local Canadian lender. At maturity, the PE firm returns the USD40 
million to the dealer and in return receives the CAD50 million, which it uses 
to pay off its lender.
Periodic payments.
At each swap payment date, the Canadian PE firm receives interest on Canadian 
dollars ( N) in exchange for paying interest on US dollars ( N × S0). Importantly, 
the “basis” component (of −15 bps) will be included along with the semiannual 
Canadian dollar reference floating rate.
Suppose that on the first settlement date the semiannual reference floating 
rate in Canadian dollars is 1.95% and the basis is −15 bps. Therefore, the Canadian 
dollar rate on the swap is 1.80% (= 1.95% − 15 bps), and we assume the US dollar 
rate is 2.50% (the semiannual reference floating rate). For the PE firm, the first 
of a sequence of periodic cash flows resulting from the swap amounts to:
PE Firm Swap DealerCAD50 million × 1.80% × 180/360 = CAD450,000 (A)
CAD50million × 0.8000 USD/CAD × 2.50% × 180/360 = USD500,000 (B)
The interest rate payment on the PE firm’s loan is CAD50 million × (1.95% 
+ 0.65%) × (180/360) = CAD650,000. Considering the CAD450,000 received on 
the swap (A), the PE firm’s net payment is CAD200,000.
At USD/CAD 0.8000, this net payment of CAD200,000 corresponds to a 
payment of USD160,000, which when added to the USD500,000 paid on the 
swap (B) totals USD660,000. Importantly, note that had the Canadian PE firm 
taken out the US loan instead, it would have paid periodically USD700,000 (= 
USD40 million × [2.50% + 1.0%] × [180/360]).
Flows at maturity.
At the maturity of the swap (and after a successful exit from the LBO via a US 
IPO), the Canadian PE firm swaps back US dollars in exchange for Canadian 
dollars (USD × 1/ S0).
PE Firm Swap DealerCAD50 million (= USD40million × 1/0.8000)
USD40 million
In this specific example, it is worth noting that the exchange rate was assumed 
not to change.
A common use of currency swaps by investors is in transactions meant to earn 
extra yield by investing in a foreign bond market and swapping the proceeds into the 
domestic currency. Given that the investment is hedged against the risk of exchange 
rate fluctuations, this corresponds to a synthetic domestic yield, but the repackaging 
allows the investor to earn a higher yield compared with the yield from direct pur -
chase of the domestic asset, because of the level of the basis on the cross-currency 
swap. For example, during periods when demand for US dollars is strong relative to 
demand for Japanese yen (JPY), the US–Japan interest rate differential implied by the 
currency markets may be significantly wider than the actual interest rate differential. 
During such a period, a US investor might choose among the following two options: 
(1) Invest in short-term US Treasury bonds, or (2) use a cross-currency swap to lend 
an equivalent amount of US dollars and buy yen; buy short-term Japanese govern -
ment debt; each period pay yen and receive US dollars on the swap; and at maturity 
swap an equivalent amount of yen back into US dollars. When the basis is largely 
negative, due to relatively weak (strong) demand for yen (US dollars) from swap 
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 98
market participants, the borrowing costs in yen (US dollars) are low (high), making 
the return from lending US dollars via a cross-currency swap particularly attractive. 
By choosing Option 2, the investor can earn more than he could from the investment 
in short-term US Treasury debt.
The rates on the cross-currency basis swaps will depend on the demand for US 
dollar funding, because when the US dollar reference floating rate is elevated, the 
counterparty receiving US dollars at initiation of the swap will be willing to receive 
a lower interest rate on the non-dollar currency periodic payments. Exhibit 1  shows 
the levels of the basis for one-year cross-currency swaps from May 2016 to April 
2018 in the Australian dollar (AUD), the Canadian dollar (CAD), the euro (EUR), and 
the British pound (GBP) versus USD Libor (quoted as six-month USD Libor versus 
six-month AUD bank bills, six-month CAD Libor, six-month Euribor, and six-month 
GBP Libor, respectively). Cross-currency basis spreads vary over time and are driven 
by credit and liquidity factors, and supply and demand for cross-currency financing. 
As noted previously, relatively strong demand for US dollar financing against the 
foreign currency would require the US dollar “borrower” in the swap to accept a 
lower rate on the periodic foreign currency cash flows it receives—for example, the 
foreign periodic reference rate less the basis. As shown in Exhibit 1 , during the period 
covered this was the case for US dollar borrowers receiving periodic swap payments 
in all currencies shown except the Australian dollar.

Currency Forwards and Futures
Currency forwards and futures are actively used to manage currency risk. These two 
financial instruments are used to hedge against undesired moves in the exchange rate 
by buying or selling a specified amount of foreign currency, at a defined time in the 
future and at an agreed-on price at contract initiation. Futures contracts are standard -
ized and best meet dealers’ and investors’ needs to manage their portfolios’ currency 
risk. Corporations often use customized forward contracts to manage the risk of cash 
flows in foreign currencies because they can be customized according to their needs.
For example, consider the general partner of a US-based venture capital (VC) firm 
that is calling down capital commitments for investment in “fintech” startups in Silicon 
Valley. It will receive in 30 days a payment of CAD50 million from a limited partner 
residing in Vancouver, British Columbia, and will immediately transfer the funds to 
its US dollar account. If the Canadian dollar were to depreciate versus the US dollar 
before the payment date, the US VC firm will receive fewer US dollars in exchange for 
Managing Equity Risk 99
the CAD50 million. To eliminate the foreign exchange risk associated with receiving 
this capital commitment, the firm can fix the price of the US dollars now via a forward 
contract in which it promises to sell CAD50 million for an agreed-on number of US 
dollars, based on the forward exchange rate, in 30 days.
EXAMPLE 8
Hedging Currency Risk with Futures
1. Consider the same US-based VC firm that is calling down capital commit -
ments and will receive CAD50 million in 30 days. The general partner now 
decides to sell futures contracts to lock in the current USD/CAD rate. The 
hedge ratio is assumed to be equal to 1. The firm hedges its risk by selling 
Canadian dollar futures contracts with the closest expiry to the future Cana -
dian dollar inflow.
Given a price for the Canadian dollar futures contract of USD/CAD 
0.7838 (number of US dollars for 1 Canadian dollar) and a contract size of 
CAD100,000, determine how many Canadian dollar futures contracts the 
VC firm must sell to hedge its risk.
Solution:
To hedge the risk of the Canadian dollar depreciating against the US dollar, 
the VC firm must sell 500 futures contracts:
    CAD 50, 000, 000  ____________   CAD 100, 000   = 500 contracts  
When the futures contracts expire, the VC firm will receive (pay) any depre -
ciation (appreciation) in the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar compared 
with the futures contract price of USD0.7838/CAD.7 If the changes in 
futures and spot prices are equal during the life of the futures contract, the 
hedge will be fully effective. A basis risk arises when the differential given 
by Futures pricet − Spot pricet is either positive or negative. In the absence 
of arbitrage, between the time when a hedging position is initiated and the 
time when it is liquidated, this spread may either widen or narrow to zero.
MANAGING EQUITY RISK
demonstrate how equity swaps, forwards, and futures can be used to 
modify a portfolio’s risk and return
Investors can achieve or modify their equity risk exposures using equity swaps and 
equity forwards and futures. The asset underlying these financial instruments could 
be an equity index, a single stock, or a basket of stocks.
7 Remember that, assuming covered interest rate parity holds, the forward rate     (   F  f/d   )     —expressed as units 
of foreign currency ( f) for 1 unit of domestic currency ( d)—is calculated from the exchange spot rate     (   S  f/d   )      
and the differential between the foreign ( if) and domestic ( id) interest rates. The forward rate is calculated 
on the basis of the following formula:   F  f/d   =  S  f/d   ×    [     (  1 +  i  f   × ACT / 360 )     /    (  1 +  i  d   × ACT / 360 )     ]     .4
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 100
Equity Swaps
An equity swap is a derivative contract in which two parties agree to exchange a series 
of cash flows whereby one party pays a variable series that will be determined by a 
single stock, a basket of stocks, or an equity index and the other party pays either 
(1) a variable series determined by a different equity or rate or (2) a fixed series. An 
equity swap is used to convert the returns from an equity investment into another 
series of returns, which either can be derived from another equity series or can be a 
fixed rate. There are three main types of equity swaps:
 ■receive-equity return, pay-fixed;
 ■receive-equity return, pay-floating; and
 ■receive-equity return, pay-another equity return.
Because they are an OTC derivative instrument, each counterparty in the equity 
swap bears credit risk exposure to the other. For this reason, equity swaps are usu -
ally collateralized in order to reduce the credit risk exposure. At the same time, as 
equity swaps are created in the OTC market, they can be customized as desired by 
the counterparties.
A total return swap is a slightly modified equity swap; it also includes in the per -
formance any dividends paid by the underlying stocks or index during the period until 
the swap maturity. The swap has a fixed tenor and may provide for one single payment 
at the end of the swap’s life, although more typically a series of periodic payments 
would be arranged instead. In another variation, at the time of each periodic payment, 
the notional amount could be reset or remain unchanged.
Equity swaps provide synthetic exposure to physical stocks. They are preferred by 
some investors over ownership of shares when access to a specific market is limited, 
when taxes are levied for owning physical stocks (e.g., stamp duty) but are not levied 
on swaps, the custodian fees are high, or the cost of monitoring the stock position 
is elevated (e.g., because of corporate actions). However, it is important to note that 
equity swaps require putting up collateral, are relatively illiquid contracts, and do not 
confer voting rights.
Example 9  shows how an equity swap might be used by an institutional investor 
with a portfolio indexed to the performance of the S&P 500 Index. He believes the 
stock market will decline over the next six months and would like to temporarily 
hedge part of the market exposure of his portfolio. He can do this by entering into a 
six-month equity swap with one payment at termination, exchanging the total return 
on the S&P 500 for a floating rate. We will consider two scenarios: In the first scenario, 
in six months the underlying portfolio is up 5%; in the second, it is down 5%.
EXAMPLE 9
Six-Month Equity Swap
An institutional investor holds a $100 million portfolio of US stocks indexed to 
the S&P 500. He expects the index will fall in the next six months and wants to 
reduce his market exposure by 30%. He enters into an equity swap with notional 
principal of $30 million whereby he agrees to pay the return on the index and 
to receive the floating reference interest rate, assumed to be 2.25%, minus 25 
bps—so, 2.00% per annum.
Scenario 1:
In the first scenario, the stock market has increased by 5%. Thus, at swap set -
tlement the institutional investor has an obligation to pay 5% × $30 million, or 
$1.5 million, and would receive 2% × 180/360 × $30 million, or $300,000. The 
Managing Equity Risk 101
two parties would net the payments and provide for a single payment of $1.2 
million, which the institutional investor would pay. Because the portfolio has 
gained $5 million in this scenario, the profit and loss (P&L) on the combined 
position (including the original portfolio and the swap) is positive and equal 
to $3.8 million.
 
Scenario 1 Equity Portfolio Rises 5%
 
 
US equity portfolio: $100 million × 5% = +$5,000,000
P&L on the stock portfolio: +$5,000,000
   
Swap settlement:  
Pay: $30 million × 5% = −$1,500,000
Receive: $30 million × 2% × 180/360 = +$300,000
Net payment on the swap: −$1,200,000
P&L on the net position (70% of original exposure and 30% 
hedged):  
$5,000,000 − $1,200,000 = +$3,800,000
 
Scenario 2:
In the second scenario, the stock market has decreased by 5%. So, it is slightly 
more complicated because the equity return that the institutional investor must 
pay is negative , which means he will receive money. He would receive $1.5 mil -
lion because the S&P 500 had a negative performance in addition to receiving 
the $300,000. Because the portfolio has lost $5 million in this case, the P&L on 
the combined position is −$3.2 million. When the swap ends, the institutional 
investor returns to the same position in which he started, with the equity port -
folio fully invested, and it is thereafter subject to full market risk once again.
 
Scenario 2 Equity Portfolio Declines 5%
 
 
US equity portfolio: $100 million × −5% = −$5,000,000
P&L on the stock portfolio: −$5,000,000
   
Swap settlement:  
Receive (Pay negative return): $30 million × 5% =+$1,500,000
Receive: $30 million × 2% × 180/360 = +$300,000
Net payment on the swap: +$1,800,000
P&L on the net position (70% of original exposure and 30% 
hedged):  
−$5,000,000 + $1,800,000 = −$3,200,000
 
To test the reasonableness of the result, a portfolio comprising 70% equities and 
30% money market instruments assumed to earn 2% (1% over the six months) 
would achieve a return of 3.8% (= 0.7 × 5% + 0.3 × [2%/2]) or $3.8 million on 
$100 million in the bullish scenario (Scenario 1). In the bearish scenario (Scenario 
2), the return would be −3.2% (= 0.7 × −5% + 0.3 × [2%/2]) or −$3.2 million on 
the initial $100 million portfolio. The total return swap effectively removes the 
risk associated with 30% of the equity portfolio allocation and converts it into 
money market equivalent returns.
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 102
Consider now a private high-net-worth investor who holds a large, concentrated 
position in a particular company’s stock that pays dividends on a regular basis. She 
expects that in the next six months the total return from the stock, including the 
dividends received, will be negative, so she wants to temporarily neutralize her long 
exposure. At the same time, she does not wish to lose ownership and her voting rights 
by selling the stock on an exchange.
This investor can enter into a total return swap requiring her to transfer the total 
performance of the stock (i.e., total return) to the counterparty of the swap, at pre -
specified dates for an agreed-on fee. Under the terms of the swap, she will pay to the 
counterparty the share price appreciation plus the dividends received over the life of 
the contract. If the stock price decreases, she will receive the share price depreciation 
but net of the dividends. At the same prespecified dates, the investor will receive in 
exchange from the counterparty an agreed-on floating-rate interest payment based 
on the swap notional.
Equity swaps that have a single stock as underlying can be cash settled or phys -
ically settled. If the swap is cash settled, on the termination date of the contract the 
equity swap receiver will receive (pay) the equity appreciation (depreciation) in cash. 
If the swap is physically settled, on the termination date the equity swap receiver will 
receive the quantity of single stock specified in the contract and pay the notional 
amount. Let us assume for example that a portfolio manager is the receiver in a 
six-month equity swap with notional principal of €4.5 million and no interim cash 
flows that requires physical settlement, at maturity, of 300,000 shares of the Italian 
insurer Generali. At maturity of the swap, the portfolio manager will receive 300,000 
shares of Generali and will pay €4.5 million, which corresponds to a purchase price 
per share of €15 (= €4.5 million/300,000). He will also pay the interest on the swap 
based on the agreed-on rate. Now let us also assume that at the swap’s maturity the 
price of Generali is €16. This price implies a gain of €300,000 (= [€16 − €15] × 300,000) 
for the portfolio manager, assuming he sells the shares received in the swap at €16. 
If the same swap had cash settlement, instead of physical settlement, at maturity the 
portfolio manager would have received €300,000—given by €16 (the swap settlement 
price) less €15 (the agreed price on the swap) and multiplied by 300,000—against the 
payment of the interest on the swap.
Equity Forwards and Futures
Equity index futures are an indispensable tool for many investment managers: They 
are a low-cost instrument to implement tactical allocation decisions, achieve portfolio 
diversification, and attain international exposure. They are standardized contracts 
listed on an exchange, and when the underlying is a stock index, only cash settlement 
is available at contract expiration.
Single stock futures are also available to investors to acquire the desired exposure 
to a specific stock. This exposure is also achievable with equity forwards, which are 
OTC contracts that are used when the counterparties need a customized agreement. 
The underlying of a single stock futures contract is one specified stock, and the inves -
tor can receive or pay its performance. At expiration, the contract could require cash 
settlement or physical settlement using the stock.
In Example 9 , rather than using an equity swap, the institutional investor could 
temporarily remove part of the market risk by selling S&P 500 Index futures. In the 
practical implementation of a stock index futures trade, we need to remember that the 
actual futures contract price is the quoted futures price times a designated multiplier. 
In determining the hedge ratio, the stock index futures price should be quoted on the 
same order of magnitude as the stock index.
Managing Equity Risk 103
For example, assume that a one-month futures contract on the S&P 500 is quoted 
at 2,700. Given the multiplier of $250, the actual futures price is equal to $675,000 (= 
2,700 × $250). We also assume that the portfolio to be hedged carries average market 
risk, meaning a beta of 1.0.8 To hedge 30% of the $100 million portfolio, the portfolio 
manager would want to sell 44 S&P 500 futures contracts, determined as follows:
    $30 million _ 2, 700   (  $250 )       = 44.444  ≈ 44 contracts  
Suppose the institutional investor sold the 44 futures at 2,700 and at expiration the 
S&P 500 rises  by 0.5%. The cash settlement of the contract is at 2,713.5. Because the 
futures position is short and the index rose, there is a “loss” of 13.5 index points—
each point being worth $250—on 44 contracts, for a total cash outflow, paid by the 
institutional investor, of $148,500:
 −13.5 points per contract × $250 per point × 44 contracts = −$148,500 (a loss).
If the S&P 500 Index rose by 0.5%, the 30% of the portfolio that has been hedged 
would also be expected to rise by the same amount, but there is a small difference 
due to rounding the number of futures contracts used for the hedge:
 $30,000,000 × 0.5% = $150,000.
If instead the S&P 500 fell by 0.5%, the numbers would be the same, but the signs would 
change. The institutional investor would receive the “gain” because he had a short 
stock index futures position when the index fell, which would offset the loss on the 
hedged portion of his stock portfolio. In sum, the equity market risk is hedged away.
In the previous example, the beta of the portfolio was the same as the beta of 
the equity index futures. This situation usually does not occur, and in most hedging 
strategies, it is necessary to determine the exact “hedge ratio” in terms of the number 
of futures contracts. Consider that the investment manager wishes to change the beta 
of the equity portfolio, βS, to a target beta of βT. Because the value of the futures 
contract begins each day at zero, the dollar beta of the combination of stocks and 
futures, assuming the target beta is achieved, is βTS, where S is the market value of 
the stock portfolio.9 The number of futures contracts we shall use is Nf, which can 
be determined by setting the target dollar beta equal to the dollar beta of the stock 
portfolio (βSS) and the dollar beta of Nf futures ( NfβfF), where βf is the beta of the 
futures and F is the value per futures contract:
 βTS = βSS + NfβfF
We then solve for Nf and obtain
   N  f   =    (     β  T   −  β  S   _  β  f     )       (    S _ F   )      (10)
Note that if the investor wants to increase the portfolio’s beta, βT will exceed βS and 
the sign of Nf will be positive, which means that she must buy futures. If she wants 
to decrease the beta, βT will be less than βS, the sign of Nf will be negative, and she 
must sell futures. This relationship should make sense: Selling futures will offset some 
of the risk of holding the stock, whereas buying futures will add risk.
In the special case in which the goal is to eliminate market risk, βT would be set 
to zero and the formula would reduce to
8 If the portfolio carried above-market risk—say, with a beta of 1.10—the number of contracts needed to 
hedge would increase by this factor. Similarly, a lower-risk portfolio would require proportionately fewer 
contracts.
9 Recall that the market value of the portfolio will still be the same as the market value of the stock, 
because the value of the futures is zero. The futures value becomes zero whenever it is marked to market, 
which takes place at the end of each day. In other words, the target beta does not appear to be applied to 
the value of the futures in the preceding analysis because the value of the futures is zero.
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 104
   N  f   = −    (     β  S   _  β  f     )       (    S _ F   )     
In this case, the sign of Nf will always be negative, which makes sense, because in 
order to hedge away all the market risk, futures must be sold.
EXAMPLE 10
Increasing the Beta of a Portfolio with Futures
Paulo Bianchi is the manager of a fund that invests in UK defensive stocks, such 
as consumer staples producers and utilities. His firm’s market outlook for the 
next quarter has become more positive, so Bianchi decides to increase the beta 
on the £40 million portfolio he manages from its current level of βS = 0.85 to βT 
= 1.10 for the next three months. He will execute this increase in equity market 
risk exposure using futures on the FTSE 100 Index. The futures contract price is 
currently £7,300, the contract’s multiplier is £10 per index point (so each futures 
contract is worth £73,000), and its beta, βf, is 1.00.
At the end of the three-month period, the UK stock market has increased 
by 2%. The stock portfolio has increased in value to £40,680,000, calculated as 
£40,000,000 × [1 + (0.02 × 0.85)]. The FTSE 100 futures contract has risen to 
£74,460.
1. Determine the appropriate number of FTSE 100 Index futures Bianchi 
should buy to increase the portfolio’s beta to 1.10.
Solution to 1:
Using Equation 10 and the preceding data, the appropriate number of fu -
tures contracts to buy to increase the portfolio’s beta to 1.10 would be 137.
   N  f   =    (     β  T   −  β  S   _  β  f     )       (    S _ F   )     =    (    1.10 − 0.85 _  1.00   )       (    £40, 000, 000 _  £73, 000   )     
 = 136.99  (rounded to 137)  
2. Demonstrate how the effective beta of the portfolio of stocks and the FTSE 
100 Index futures matched Bianchi’s target beta of 1.10.
Solution to 2:
The profit on the futures contracts is 137 × (£74,460 − £73,000) = £200,020. 
Adding the profit from the futures to the value of the stock portfolio gives 
a total market value of £40,680,000 + £200,020 = £40,880,020. The rate of 
return for the combined position is
    £40, 880, 020 _ £40, 000, 000   − 1 = 0.0220 , or 2.2% 
Because the market went up by 2% and the overall gain was 2.2%, the effec -
tive beta of the portfolio was
    0.0220 _ 0.020   = 1.10 
Thus, the effective beta matched the target beta of 1.10.
Volatility Derivatives: Futures and Options 105
Cash Equitization
Cash securitization (also known as “cash equitization” or “cash overlay”) is a strategy 
designed to boost returns by finding ways to “equitize” unintended cash holdings. By 
purchasing futures contracts, fund managers attempt to replicate the performance of 
the underlying market in which the cash would have been invested. Given the liquidity 
of the futures market, doing so would be relatively easy. An alternative solution could 
be to purchase calls and sell puts on the underlying asset with the same exercise price 
and expiry date.
In this case, we have a cash holding, implying βS = 0, so the number of futures 
(with beta of βf) that would need to be purchased in a cash equitization transaction 
is given by
   N  f   =    (     β  T   _  β  f     )       (    S _ F   )      (11)
EXAMPLE 11
Cash Equitization
1. Akari Fujiwara manages a large equity fund denominated in Japanese yen 
that is indexed to the Nikkei 225 stock index. She determines that the cur -
rent level of excess cash that has built up in the portfolio amounts to JPY140 
million. She decides to purchase futures contracts to replicate the return on 
her fund’s target index. Nikkei 225 index futures currently trade at a price of 
JPY23,000 per contract, the contract multiplier is JPY1,000 per index point 
(so each futures contract is worth JPY23 million), and the beta, βf, is 1.00.
Determine the appropriate number of futures Fujiwara must buy to equitize 
her portfolio’s excess cash position.
Solution:
Using Equation 11, which assumes βS = 0, the answer is found as follows:
   N  f   =    (     β  T   _  β  f     )       (    S _ F   )     =    (    1.00 _ 1.00   )       (    JPY140, 000, 000  ____________   JPY23, 000, 000   )     = 6.087  (rounded to 6)  
The appropriate number of futures to buy to equitize the portfolio’s excess 
cash position, based on the data provided, would be six contracts.
VOLATILITY DERIVATIVES: FUTURES AND OPTIONS
demonstrate the use of volatility derivatives and variance swaps
With the introduction of volatility futures and variance swaps, many investors now 
consider volatility an asset class in itself. In particular, long volatility exposure can be 
an effective hedge against a sell-off in a long equity portfolio, notably during periods 
of extreme market movements. Empirical studies have identified a negative correla -
tion between volatility and stock index returns that becomes pronounced during 
stock market downturns. Importantly, variance swaps, which will be discussed in this 5
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 106
section, have a valuable convexity feature—as realized volatility increases (decreases), 
the positive (negative) swap payoffs increase (decrease)—that makes them particularly 
attractive for hedging long equity portfolios. For example, some investors use strategies 
that systematically allocate to volatility futures or variance swaps to hedge the “tail” 
risk of their portfolios. Naturally, the counterparties are selling a kind of insurance; 
they expect such return tails will not materialize. The effectiveness of such hedges 
should be compared against more traditional “long volatility” hedging methods, such 
as implementing a rolling series of out-of-the-money put options or futures. The roll 
aspect affects portfolio returns, so the term structure should be carefully considered. 
For example, if futures prices are in backwardation (contango), then overall returns 
to an investor with a long position in the futures would be enhanced (diminished) 
owing to positive (negative) roll return. The results are necessarily reversed for the 
holder of the short futures position. In sum, all these derivatives strategies should 
be assessed on the basis of their ability to reduce portfolio risk and improve returns. 
In contrast, a common investment strategy implemented by opportunistic investors 
involves being systematically short volatility, thereby attempting to capture the risk 
premium embedded in option prices. This strategy is most profitable under stable 
market conditions, but it can lead to large losses if market volatility rises unexpectedly.
Volatility Futures and Options
The CBOE Volatility Index, known as the VIX or the “fear index, ” is a measure of 
investors’ expectations of volatility in the S&P 500 over the next 30 days. It is calculated 
and published by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and is based on the 
prices of S&P 500 Index options. The CBOE began publishing real-time VIX data in 
1993, and in 2004, VIX futures were introduced. Investors cannot invest directly in 
the VIX but instead must use VIX futures contracts that offer investors a pure play 
on the level of expected stock market volatility, regardless of the direction of the 
S&P 500. Volatility futures allow investors to implement their views depending on 
their expectations about the timing and magnitude of a change in implied volatility. 
For example, in order for a long VIX futures position to protect an equity portfolio 
during a downturn, the stock market’s implied volatility, as derived from S&P 500 
Index options, must increase by more than the consensus expectation of implied 
volatility prior to the sell-off.
A family of volatility indexes has also been introduced for European equity mar -
kets, and they are designed to reflect market expectations of near-term to long-term 
volatility. The most well known of these is the VSTOXX index, based on real-time 
option prices on the EURO STOXX 50 index. The family of volatility indexes also 
includes the VDAX-NEW Index, based on DAX stock index options.
Next, we discuss various shapes of the VIX futures term structure. The CBOE 
Futures Exchange (CFE) lists nine standard (monthly) VIX index futures contracts 
and six weekly expirations in VIX futures. Each weekly and monthly contract settles 
30 calendar days prior to the subsequent standard S&P 500 Index option’s expiration. 
The weekly futures have lower volumes and open interest than the monthly futures 
contracts have. Exhibit 2  presents the first six monthly VIX futures contracts at three 
different fixed points in time for all expires; these are not consecutive days but, rather, 
are at intervals of about two months apart.

Day 1 Day 60 Day 120
The shape of the VIX futures curve is always changing, reflecting the current volatility 
environment, investors’ expectations regarding the future level of volatility, and the 
buying and selling activity in VIX futures contracts by market participants. Depending 
on the mix of these factors, the VIX futures term structure can change from being 
positively sloped to flat or inverted in just a few months’ time.
Day 1 illustrates what happens when volatility is expected to remain stable over 
the near to long term: The term structure of VIX futures is flat. Day 60 shows the VIX 
futures in backwardation. This situation typically is a signal that investors expect more 
volatility in the short term and thus require higher prices for shorter-term contracts 
than for longer-term ones. In contrast, Day 120 is an example of the VIX futures 
being in contango. The curve is upward sloped, and it is steep for VIX buyers, with 
nearly 4.3 volatility points between the April and May expiries. Higher longer-term 
VIX futures prices are interpreted as an expectation that the VIX will rise because of 
increasing long-term volatility.
The VIX futures converge to the spot VIX as expiration approaches, so the two must 
be equal at expiration. When the VIX futures curve is in contango (backwardation) 
and assuming volatility expectations remain unchanged, the VIX futures price will 
get “pulled” closer to the VIX spot price, and they will decrease (increase) in price as 
they approach expiration. Traders calculate the daily roll as the difference between 
the front-month VIX futures price and the VIX spot price, divided by the number of 
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 108
business days until the VIX futures contract settles. Assuming that the basis declines 
linearly until settlement, when the term structure is in contango (backwardation), the 
trader who is long in back-month VIX futures would realize roll-down losses (profits).
Importantly, VIX futures may not reflect the index, especially when the VIX expe -
riences large spikes, because longer-maturity futures contracts are less sensitive to 
short-term VIX movements. Furthermore, establishing long positions in VIX futures 
can be very expensive over time. When the short end of the VIX futures curve is much 
steeper than the long end of the curve, the carrying costs created from the contract 
roll down are elevated.
This phenomenon is particularly evident for investors who cannot invest directly in 
futures but must invest in volatility funds that attempt to track the VIX. These funds 
have attracted interest and substantial money flows because they are easily accessed 
in the form of exchange-traded products (ETPs) and, in particular, exchange-traded 
notes (ETNs) that provide exposure to short- and medium-term VIX futures. Some 
of these products also provide leveraged exposure. When using these investment 
products to hedge against a rise in the VIX, the VIX futures term structure should be 
taken into in consideration because volatility ETPs typically hold a mix of VIX futures 
that is adjusted daily to keep the average time to expiration of the portfolio constant. 
The daily rebalancing requires shorter-term futures to be sold and longer-dated 
futures to be purchased. When the VIX futures are in contango, the cost of rolling 
over hedges (i.e., negative carry) increases, thereby reducing profits and causing the 
ETP to underperform relative to the movement in the VIX. In contrast, “inverse” VIX 
ETPs offer investors the opportunity to profit from decreases in S&P 500 volatility. 
However, the purchase of these funds implies a directional positioning on volatility, 
and investors must accept the risk of large losses when volatility increases sharply.
In 2006, VIX options were introduced, providing an asymmetrical exposure to 
potential increases or decreases in anticipated volatility. VIX options are European 
style, and their prices depend on the prices of VIX futures with similar expirations 
because the market makers of VIX options typically hedge the risk of their option 
positions using VIX futures. To understand the use of VIX calls and puts, it is very 
important to recognize that the increases in the VIX (and VIX futures) are negatively 
correlated with the prices of equity assets. In particular, a trader or investor would 
purchase VIX call options when he expects that volatility will increase owing to a sig -
nificant sell-off in the equity market. In contrast, VIX put options would be bought to 
profit from an expectation that volatility will decrease because of stable equity market 
conditions. Options on the VSTOXX index also exist, but they have lower volumes 
and open interest than those on the VIX.
VOLATILITY DERIVATIVES: VARIANCE SWAPS
demonstrate the use of volatility derivatives and variance swaps
Variance swaps are instruments used by investors for taking directional bets on implied 
versus realized volatility for speculative or hedging purposes. The term “variance swap” 
refers to the fact that these instruments have a payoff analogous to that of a swap. In 
a variance swap, the buyer of the contract will pay the difference between the fixed 
variance strike  agreed on in the contract and the realized variance  (annualized) on the 
underlying over the period specified and applied to a variance notional. In variance 
swaps, there is no exchange of cash at the contract inception or during the life of the 
swap. The payoff at expiration of a long variance position will be positive (negative) 6
Volatility Derivatives: Variance Swaps 109
when realized variance is greater (less) than the swap’s variance strike. If the payment 
amount is positive (negative), the swap seller (buyer) pays the swap buyer (seller). The 
payoff at settlement is found as follows:
 Settlement amountT 
 =  
(Variance notional)(Realized variance − Variance strike)  
 (12)
The realized variance is calculated as follows, where Ri = ln( Pi+1/Pi) and N is the 
number of days observed:
  Realized variance  = 252 ×    [    ∑ 
i=1  N−1
  R  i  2   /    (  N − 1 )     ]      (13)
Since most market participants are accustomed to thinking in terms of volatility, 
variance swap traders typically agree on the following two things: (1) a variance swap 
trade size expressed in vega notional , NVega (not in variance notional), and (2) the 
strike ( X), which represents the expected future variance of the underlying, expressed 
as volatility (not variance). This approach is intuitive because the vega notional rep -
resents the average profit and loss of the variance swap for a 1% change in volatility 
from the strike. For example, when the vega notional is $50,000, the profit and loss 
for one volatility point of difference between the realized volatility and the strike will 
be close to $50,000.
We must bear in mind that this is an approximation because the variance swap 
payoff is convex and the profit and loss is not linear for changes in the realized vola -
tility. Specifically, to calculate the exact payoff, the variance strike is the strike squared 
and the variance notional , Nvariance , is defined and calculated as
  Variance notional  =   Vega notional  ___________   2 × Strike price    (14)
Thus, given the realized volatility (σ), we have the following equivalence:
   Settlement amount   T   =  N  Vega     (     σ   2  −  X   2  ___________   2 × Strike price   )     =  N  variance     (   σ   2  −  X   2  )      (15)
The strike on a variance swap is calculated on the basis of the implied volatility skew 
for a specific expiration, derived from calls and puts quoted in the market. As dis -
cussed previously, volatility skew is a plot of the differences in implied volatilities of 
a basket of options with the same maturity and underlying asset but with different 
strikes (and thus moneyness). As a rule of thumb, the strike of a variance swap typically 
corresponds to the implied volatility of the put that has 90% moneyness (calculated 
as the option’s strike divided by the current level of the underlying).
The mark-to-market valuation of a variance swap at time t (VarSwapt) will depend 
on realized volatility from the swap’s initiation to t, RealizedVol(0, t), and implied 
volatility at t, ImpliedVol( t,T), over the remaining life of the swap ( T − t ). PVt(T) is 
the present value at time t of $1 received at maturity T. The value of a variance swap 
at time t is given by the following formula:10
   Var  Swap   t   = Variance notional  × P  V  t     (  T )     ×
        {    t _ T   ×   [  RealizedV ol    (  0, t )     ]     2  +   T − t _ T   ×   [  ImpliedV ol    (  t, T )     ]     2  −  Strike    2  }       (16)
Importantly, the sensitivity of a variance swap to changes in implied volatility dimin -
ishes over time.
10 Note that the terms in the braces—RealizedVol, ImpliedVol, and Strike—are all expressed in volatility 
units. They are squared so that they are expressed in variance units for determining the value of a variance 
swap.
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 110
A feature of variance swaps that makes them particularly interesting to investors 
is that their payoffs are convex in volatility, as seen Exhibit 4 . This convexity occurs 
because being long a variance swap is equivalent to be long a basket of options and 
short the underlying asset (typically by selling a futures contract). A long position in a 
variance swap is thus long gamma and has a convex payoff. This characteristic allows 
volatility sellers to sell variance swaps at a higher price than at-the-money options 
because the swap’s convex payoff profile is attractive to investors who desire a long 
volatility position as a tail risk hedge.

EXAMPLE 12
Variance Swap Valuation and Settlement
Olivia Santos trades strategies that systematically sell volatility on the S&P 500 
Index. She sells $50,000 vega notional of a one-year variance swap on the S&P 
500 at a strike of 20% (quoted as annual volatility).
Now six months have passed, and the S&P 500 has experienced a realized 
volatility of 16% (annualized). On the same day, the fair strike of a new six-month 
variance swap on the S&P 500 is 19%.
Determine the following:
1. The current value of the variance swap sold by Santos (note that the annual 
interest rate is 2.5%)
Solution to 1:
Santos sold $50,000 vega notional of a one-year variance swap on the S&P 
500 with a strike (in volatility terms) of 20%. The value of the variance swap 
sold by Santos is found using Equation 16:
    VarSwap   t   = Variance notional  × P  V  t     (  T )     ×
        {    t _ T   ×   [  RealizedV ol    (  0, t )     ]     2  +   T − t _ T   ×   [  ImpliedV ol    (  t, T )     ]     2  −  Strike    2  }      
Values for the inputs are as follows:
Volatility strike on existing swap = 20.
Using Derivatives in Asset Allocation 111
Variance strike on existing swap = 202 = 400.
From Equation 14, Variance notional =    Vega notional  ___________  2 × Strike   =   $50, 000 _ 2 × 20   = 1, 250 .
RealizedV ol(0, t)2 = 162 = 256.
ImpliedV ol( t,T)2 = 192 = 361.
t = 6 months.
T = 12 months.
PVt(T) = 1/[1 + (2.5% × 6/12)] = 0.987654 (= Present Value Interest Factor for six 
months, where the annual rate is 2.5%).
The current value of the swap is
VarSwapt = 1,250 × (0.987654) × [(6/12) × 256 + (6/12) × 361 − 400]
 = −$112,962.9263.
Given that Santos is short the variance swap, the mark-to-market value is 
positive for her, and it equals $112,963.
2. The settlement amount at expiration of the swap if the one-year realized 
volatility is 18%
Solution to 2:
The settlement amount is calculated using Equation 12 as follows:
SettlementT = Variance notional × (Realized variance − Variance strike) = 1,250 × 
(182 − 202)
 = −$95,000
If the payment amount is positive (negative), the swap seller (buyer) pays the 
swap buyer (seller). So, in this case, Santos would receive $95,000 from the 
swap buyer.

Bernhard Steinbacher has a client with a holding of 100,000 shares in Tundra 
Corporation, currently trading for €14 per share. The client has owned the shares 
for many years and thus has a very low tax basis on this stock. Steinbacher wants to 
safeguard the value of the position since the client does not want to sell the shares. 
He cannot find exchange-traded options on the stock. Steinbacher wants to present 
a way in which the client could protect the investment portfolio from a decline in 
Tundra’s stock price.
Discuss a swap strategy that Steinbacher might recommend to his client.7
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 112
Solution:
A possible solution is to enter into an equity swap trading the Tundra stock return 
for the floating reference interest rate. Given Tundra’s current share price of €14, the 
position is worth €1.4 million. Steinbacher can agree to exchange the total return  on 
the shares (which includes the price performance and the dividends received) for the 
reference rate return on this sum of money. Now he needs to determine the time over 
which the protection is needed and must match the swap tenor to this period. After 
consulting with his client, Steinbacher decides on six months. The floating reference 
rate is 0.34%, expressed as an annual rate.
Scenario A:
Over the six months, Tundra pays a €0.10 dividend and the share price rises 1%.
The total return on the stock is 
       (  14 × 1.01 )     − 14 + 0.10  _________________  14   = 1.71% . 
 For a six-month period, the reference rate return would be half the annual rate, 
or 0.17%. Tundra’s total return exceeds  the six-month reference rate return: (1.71% − 
0.17%) × €1.4 million = €21,620, which is a positive amount, so Steinbacher’s client 
would need to pay the swap counterparty.
Scenario B:
Over the six months, Tundra pays a €0.10 dividend and the share price falls 1%.
The total return on the stock is 
       (  14 × 0.99 )     − 14 + 0.10  _________________  14   = − 0.29% . 
 Tundra’s total return is less than the six-month reference rate return: (−0.29% − 
0.17%) × €1.4 million = −€6,380, which is a negative amount, so Steinbacher’s client 
would receive  the negative return and the reference rate return from the swap coun -
terparty (meaning the client will receive a positive cash inflow of €6,380).
Cash Equitization
Georgia McMillian manages a fund invested in UK stocks that is indexed to the FTSE 
100 Index. The fund has £250 million of total assets under management, including 
£20 million of cash reserves invested at the three-month British pound floating rate 
of 0.63% (annualized). McMillian does not have an expectation on the direction of UK 
stocks over the next quarter. However, she is keen to minimize tracking error risk, so 
she implements a cash equitization strategy attempting to replicate the performance of 
the FTSE 100 on the cash reserves. Futures on the FTSE 100 settling in three months 
currently trade at a price of £7,900, the contract’s value is £10 per index point (so each 
futures contract is worth £79,000), and its beta, βf, is 1.0.
McMillian engages in a synthetic index strategy to gain exposure on a notional 
amount of £20 million to the FTSE 100 by purchasing equity index futures. The number 
of futures she must purchase is given by the following:
   N  f   =    (     β  T   _  β  f     )       (    S _ F   )     =    (    1.0 _ 1.0   )       (    20, 000, 000 _  79, 000   )     = 253.16  ≈ 253 
where the beta of the futures contract, βf, and the target beta, βT, are both equal 
to 1.0.
Using Derivatives in Asset Allocation 113
Scenario: Three months later, the FTSE 100 Index has increased by 5%.
Three months later, the FTSE 100 has increased by 5%, and the original value of £230 
million invested in UK stocks has increased to £241.5 million. The price of the FTSE 
100 Index futures contract has increased to £8,282.5. Interest on the cash invested at 
the three-month floating rate amounts to £31,500 (£20,000,000 × 0.63% × 90/360). 
McMillian bought the futures at £7,900, and the cash settlement of the contract at 
is £8,282.5. So, there is a “gain” of 382.5 index points, each point being worth £10, 
on 253 contracts for a total cash inflow of £967,725 (382.5 points per contract × £10 
per point × 253 contracts). Adding to the portfolio the profit from the futures and 
the cash reserves plus the interest earned on the cash gives a total market value for 
McMillian’s portfolio of £262,499,225 (= £241,500,000 + £20,000,000 + £967,725 + 
£31,500). The rate of return for the combined position is:
    £262, 499, 225 _  £250, 000, 000   − 1 = 0.05,  or 5% 
Importantly, without implementing this strategy, McMillian’s return would have been 
slightly over 4.6%, calculated as (£230 million/£250 million) × 5.0% + (£20 million/£250 
million) × 0.63% × (90/360). So, she accomplished her goal of minimizing tracking 
error by following this strategy.

Changing Allocations between Asset Classes Using Futures
Mario Rossi manages a €500 million portfolio that is allocated 70% to stocks and 
30% to bonds. Over the next three-month horizon, he is bearish on eurozone stocks, 
except for German shares, and is bullish on Italian bonds. So, Rossi wants to reduce 
the overall allocation to stocks by 10%, to 60%, and achieve the same weight (30%) 
in Italian stocks (which have a beta of 1.1 with respect to the FTSE MIB Index) and 
German stocks (which have a beta of 0.9 with respect to the DAX index). He also 
wants to increase the overall allocation to Italian government bonds (BTPs) by 10%, to 
40%. The bond portion of his portfolio has a modified duration of 6.45. In summary, as 
shown in Exhibit 5 , Rossi needs to remove €100 million of exposure to Italian stocks, 
add €50 million of exposure to German stocks, and add €50 million of exposure to 
Italian bonds in his portfolio.8

Rossi uses stock index futures and bond futures to achieve this objective. Once the 
notional values to be traded are known, Rossi determines how many futures contracts 
should be purchased or sold to achieve the desired asset allocation. The FTSE MIB 
Index futures contract has a price of 23,100 and a multiplier of €5, for a value of 
€115,500. The DAX index futures contract has a price of 13,000 and a multiplier of 
€25, for a value of €325,000. Both futures contracts have a beta of 1. The BTP futures 
contract has a price of 132.50 and a contract size of €100,000. The cheapest-to-deliver 
bond has a price of €121; a modified duration of 8.19; a BPVCTD (from Equation 7) 
of €99.10, calculated as 8.19 × 0.0001 × [(121/100) × €100,000)]; and a conversion 
factor of 0.913292.
1. Determine how many stock index and bond futures contracts Rossi should 
use to implement the desired asset allocation and whether he should go long 
or short.
2. At the horizon date (three months later), the value of the Italian stock port -
folio has fallen 5% whereas that of the German stock portfolio has increased 
1%. The FTSE MIB futures price is 22,000, and the DAX futures price is 
13,100. Determine the change in market value of the equity portfolio assum -
ing the futures transactions specified in Part 1 have been carried out (note 
that you can ignore transaction costs).
3. At the horizon date, the Italian bond yield curve has a parallel shift down -
ward of 25 bps. Determine the change in market value of the bond portfolio 
assuming the transactions specified in Part 1 have been carried out (note 
that you can ignore transactions costs).
Solution to 1:
The market value of the Italian stocks is 0.50(€500,000,000) = €250,000,000, and Rossi 
wants to reduce the exposure to this market by 0.20(€500,000,000) = €100,000,000. 
The market value of the German stocks is 0.20(€500,000,000) = €100,000,000, and he 
wants to increase the exposure to this market by 0.10(€500,000,000) = €50,000,000. 
He decides to sell enough futures contracts on the FTSE MIB to reduce the exposure 
to Italian stocks by €100 million and to purchase enough futures on the DAX index 
to increase the exposure to German stocks by €50 million.
The number of stock index futures, Nf, is
   N  f   =    (     β  T   −  β  S   _  β  f     )       (    S _ F   )     
where βT is the target beta of zero, βS is the stock beta of 1.1, βf is the futures 
beta of 1.0, S is the market value of the stocks involved in the transaction, and F is 
the value of the futures contract.
Using Derivatives in Asset Allocation 115
To achieve the desired reduction in exposure to Italian stocks, the market value 
of the stocks involved in the transaction will be S = €100,000,000. The Italian stocks’ 
beta (βS) is 1.1, and the target beta is βT = 0. The FTSE MIB Index futures have a 
contract value of €115,500 and a beta (βf) of 1.0:
   N  f   =    (     β  T   −  β  S   _  β  f     )       (    S _ F   )     =    (    0.0 − 1.1 _ 1.0   )       (    €100, 000, 000 _  €115, 500   )     = − 952.38  
Rossi sells 952 futures contracts (after rounding).
To achieve the desired exposure to German stocks (which have a beta of 0.9), 
the market value of the stocks involved in the transaction will be S = €50,000,000. In 
this case, βS = 0.0 because Rossi is starting with a notional “cash” position from the 
reduction in Italian stock exposure, and the target beta is now βT = 0.9. Given the 
value of the DAX index futures contract of €325,000 and a beta (βf) of 1.0, we obtain
   N  f   =    (     β  T   −  β  S   _  β  f     )       (    S _ F   )     =    (    0.9 − 0.0 _ 1.0   )       (    €50, 000, 000 _  €325, 000   )     = 138.46  
Rossi buys 138 futures contracts (after rounding).
The market value of the Italian bonds is 0.30(€500,000,000) = €150,000,000, and 
Rossi wants to increase the exposure to this market by 0.10(€500,000,000) = €50,000,000. 
He decides to purchase enough Euro-BTP futures so that €50 million exposure in 
Italian bonds is added to the portfolio. The target basis point value exposure ( BPVT) 
is determined using Equation 4:
 BPVT = MDURT × 0.01% × MVP = 6.45 × 0.0001 × €50,000,000 = €32,250
The cheapest-to-deliver bond is the BTP 4¾ 09/01/28, which has a conversion factor 
of 0.913292 and BPVCTD of €99.10. The number of Euro-BTP futures to buy to convert 
the €50 million in notional cash ( BPVP = 0) to the desired exposure in Italian bonds 
is found using Equation 9:
  BPVHR =    (    BP  V  T   − BP  V  P    ___________  BP  V  CTD     )     × CF =    [     (  €32, 250 − 0 )     / €99.10  ]     × 0.913292  
 = 297.21  
Rossi buys 297 Euro-BTP futures contracts (after rounding).
Solution to 2:
The value of the Italian stock portfolio decreases by €7,264,000. This outcome is the 
net effect of the following:
 ■The original Italian stock portfolio decreases by €12,500,000 (= €250 million 
× −5%).
 ■The short position in 952 FTSE MIB futures gains €5,236,000, calculated as
 − (22,000 − 23,100) × 952 × €5.
The value of the German stock portfolio increases by €1,345,000. This outcome is 
the net effect of the following:
 ■The original German stock portfolio increases by €1,000,000 (= €100 million 
× 1%).
 ■The long position in 138 DAX futures gains €345,000, calculated as (13,100 
− 13,000) × 138 × €25.
The total value of the stock position has decreased by €5,919,000 or −1.691% (= 
−5,919,000/350,000,000).
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 116
Had Rossi sold the Italian stocks and then converted the proceeds into German 
stocks, the equity portfolio would have decreased by €6,000,000 or −1.71% (= 
−6,000,000/350,000,000). This outcome would have been the net effect of the following:
 ■A decrease in the new Italian stock portfolio of €7,500,000 (= €150 million × 
−5%)
 ■An increase in the new German stock portfolio of €1,500,000 (= €150 mil -
lion × 1%)
Solution to 3:
The Italian bond yield curve had a parallel shift downward of 25 bps. The value of 
the Italian bond portfolio increases by €3,224,426. This outcome is the net effect of 
the following:
 ■The €150 million portfolio’s BPVP, per Equation 5 , is €96,750 (= 6.45 × 
0.0001 × €150,000,000). Thus, for a 25 bp decrease in rates, the portfolio 
value increases by €2,418,750 (= €96,750 × 25).
 ■The long position in 297 BTP futures has a BPVCTD of €99.10, and the CF 
is 0.913292. So, using Equation 6, BPVF is €108.51 (= €99.10/0.913292). 
Thus, for a 25 bp decrease in rates, the futures position increases in value 
by €805,676, calculated as follows: BPVF × Change in yield × Number of 
futures contracts = €108.51 × 25 × 297.
Had Rossi bought the Italian bonds, the new €200 million bond portfolio would 
have increased by €3,225,000. The portfolio has a BPVP of 6.45 × 0.0001 × €200,000,000 
= €129,000. Thus, for a 25 bp decrease in rates, the portfolio value increases by 
€3,225,000 (= €129,000 × 25).
Rebalancing an Asset Allocation Using Futures
Yolanda Grant manages a portfolio with a target allocation of 40% in stocks and 60%

million to €106 million, and Grant wants to rebalance it back to the target allocation 
(40% stocks/60% bonds). As shown in Exhibit 6 , the current portfolio has €46 million 
(43.4%) in European stocks (with beta of 1.2 with respect to the EURO STOXX 50 index) 
and €60 million (56.6%) in German bunds. The bonds have a modified duration of 9.5.

Grant will use stock index futures and bond futures to achieve this objective. Once the 
notional values to be traded are known, she determines how many futures contracts 
should be purchased or sold to achieve the desired asset allocation.
Using Derivatives in Asset Allocation 117
The EURO STOXX 50 index futures contract has a price of 3,500 and a multiplier 
of €10, for a value of €35,000. The Euro-Bund futures contract has a contract size of 
€100,000. The cheapest-to-deliver bond has a modified duration of 8.623 and a price 
of 98.14, so (per Equation 7) its BPVCTD is €84.63, calculated as 8.623 × 0.0001 × 
[(98.14/100) × €100,000)]. Its conversion factor is 0.619489.
Determine how many stock index and bond futures contracts Grant should use 
to implement the desired asset allocation and whether she should go long or short.
Solution:
The market value of the European stocks is €46,000,000, and Grant wants to reduce 
the exposure to this market to 40% or 0.40(€106,000,000) = €42,400,000. She decides 
to sell enough futures contracts on the EURO STOXX 50 to reduce the allocation to 
European stocks by 0.034(€106,000,000) = €3,604,000.
To achieve the desired reduction in exposure to European stocks, the market value 
of the stocks involved in the transaction ( S) will be €3,604,000. The European stocks’ 
beta (βS) is 1.2, and the target beta is βT = 0. The EURO STOXX 50 index futures have 
a contract value ( F) of €35,000, with a beta (βf) of 1.0, so
   N  f   =    (     β  T   −  β  S   _  β  f     )       (    S _ F   )     =    (    0.0 − 1.2 _ 1.0   )       (    €3, 604, 000 _  €35, 000   )     = − 123.57  
Grant sells 124 futures contracts (after rounding).
The market value of the German bunds is €60,000,000, and Grant wants to 
increase the exposure to this market to 0.60(€106,000,000) = €63,600,000. She decides 
to purchase enough Euro-Bund futures so that €3,604,000 (= 0.034 × €106,000,000) 
of exposure to German bonds is added to the portfolio. The target basis point value 
(BPVT) is given by Equation 4, as follows:
 BPVT = MDURT × 0.01% × MVP = 9.5 × 0.0001 ×€3,604,000 = €3,424
The cheapest-to-deliver bond has a BPVCTD of €84.63 and a conversion factor of 
0.619489. The number of Euro-Bund futures to buy to convert the €3.6 million in 
notional cash ( BPVP = 0) to the desired exposure in German bonds is found using 
Equation 9:
   BPVHR =    (    BP  V  T   − BP  V  P    ___________  BP  V  CTD     )     × CF    
=    [     (  €3, 424 − 0 )     / €84.63  ]     × 0.619489  = 25.06  ≈ 25 contracts  
So, Grant should buy 25 Euro-Bund futures contracts.

30% in mid-cap, and 10% percent in small cap. Within the bond sector, the funds are 
invested 80% in US government bonds and 20% in investment-grade corporate bonds.
Given that it is bullish on equities, especially large-cap stocks, over the next year, 
TMM would like to change the overall allocation to 90% stocks and 10% bonds. 
Specifically, TMM would like to split the stock allocation into 65% large cap, 25% 
mid-cap, and 10% small cap. It also wants to change the bond allocation to 75% US 
government and 25% investment-grade corporate. The current position, the desired 
new position, and the necessary transactions to get from the current position to the 
new position are shown in Exhibit 7 .

TMM knows these changes would entail a considerable amount of trading in stocks 
and bonds. So, TMM decides to execute a series of swaps that would enable it to 
change its position temporarily but more easily and less expensively than by executing 
the physical transactions. TMM engages Dynamic Dealers Inc. to perform the swaps.
TMM decides to increase the allocation in the large-cap sector by investing in 
the S&P 500 Index and to increase that in the small-cap sector by investing in the 
S&P SmallCap 600 Index (SPSC). To reduce the allocation in the overall fixed-income 
sector, TMM decides to replicate the performance of the Bloomberg Barclays US 
Treasury Index (BBT) for the government bond sector and the BofA Merrill Lynch 
US Corporate Index (BAMLC) for the corporate bond sector.
Discuss how TMM can use a combination of equity and fixed-income swaps to 
synthetically implement its desired asset allocation.
Solution:
To achieve the desired asset allocation, TMM takes the following exposures:
 ■A long position of $27 million in the S&P 500
 ■A long position of $3 million in the SPSC
 ■A short position of $25 million in the BBT
 ■A short position of $5 million in the BAMLC
The mid-cap exposure of $45 million does not change, so TMM does not need 
to incorporate a mid-cap index into the swap. TMM uses a combination of equity 
and fixed-income swaps to achieve its target allocation and structures the swap to 
have all payments occur on the same dates six months apart. TMM also decides that 
the swap should mature in one year. If it wishes to extend this period, TMM would 
need to renegotiate the swap at expiration. Likewise, TMM could decide to unwind 
the position before one year elapses, which it could do by executing a new swap with 
opposite payments for the remainder of the life of the original swap.
Every six months and at maturity, each of the equity swaps involves the settlement 
of the following cash flows:
 ■Equity swap 1:  TMM receives the total return of the S&P 500 and makes 
a floating payment tied to the market reference rate (MRR) minus the 
agreed-on spread, both on a notional principal of $27 million.
 ■Equity swap 2:  TMM receives the total return of the SPSC and makes a 
floating payment tied to the MRR minus the agreed-on spread, both on a 
notional principal of $3 million.
Using Derivatives to Infer Market Expectations 119
The fixed-income swaps will require the following cash flow settlements every six 
months and at maturity:
 ■Fixed-income swap 1:  TMM pays the total return of the BBT and receives 
floating payments tied to the MRR minus the agreed-on spread, both on 
notional principal of $25 million.
 ■Fixed-income swap 2:  TMM pays the total return of the BAMLC and 
receives floating payments tied to the MRR minus the agreed-on spread, 
both on a notional principal of $5 million.
It is important to recognize that this transaction will not perfectly replicate the 
performance of TMM’s equity and fixed-income portfolios, unless they are indexed 
to the indexes selected as underlying of the swaps. In addition, TMM could encoun -
ter a cash flow problem if its fixed-income payments exceed its equity receipts and 
its portfolio does not generate enough cash to fund its net obligation. The stock and 
bond portfolio will generate cash only from dividends and interest. Capital gains will 
not be received in cash unless a portion of the portfolio is sold. But avoiding selling a 
portion of the portfolio is the very reason why TMM wants to use swaps.
USING DERIVATIVES TO INFER MARKET 
EXPECTATIONS
demonstrate the use of derivatives in asset allocation, rebalancing, 
and inferring market expectations
As mentioned at the beginning of this reading, an important use of derivatives by 
market participants is for inferring market expectations. These expectations can be for 
changes in interest rates; for changes in prices for the whole economy (i.e., inflation), 
individual stocks, or other assets; or even for changes in key factors, such as implied 
volatility. Exhibit 8  provides a brief list of some of the myriad applications by which 
information embedded in derivatives prices is used to infer current market expecta -
tions. It is important to emphasize that these inferences relate to current expectations  
of future events—they do not foretell what will actually happen—which can change 
with the arrival of new information.
Exhibit 8: Some Typical Applications of Derivatives for Inferring Market 
Expectations
Use Cases/Applications Derivative Type
1. Inferring expectations for FOMC moves Fed funds futures
2. Inferring expectations for inflation rates CPI (inflation) swaps
3. Inferring expectations for market volatility VIX futures
The first application in Exhibit 8 , using fed funds futures to infer expectations of federal 
funds rate changes by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is likely the most 
common and well-publicized use of derivatives for inferring market expectations, so 
it is the focus of the following discussion.9
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 120
Using Fed Funds Futures to Infer the Expected Average Federal 
Funds Rate
Market participants are interested in knowing the probabilities of various interest rate 
level outcomes, deriving from central banks’ future decisions, as implied by the pricing 
of financial instruments. This provides them with an indication about the extent to 
which markets are “pricing in” future monetary policy changes. Note that such implied 
probabilities represent the market’s view and may diverge from the guidance provided 
by central banks in their regular communications about the likely future course of 
monetary policy actions. Furthermore, especially for the longer-term horizon, these 
inferred probabilities usually do not have strong predictive power. Most information 
providers and the business media report current implied probability data for selected 
interest rates and historical analysis charts that show how the implied probabilities 
of policy rate settings have changed over time.
A commonly followed metric is the probability of a change in the federal funds 
rate at upcoming FOMC meetings that is implied by the prices of fed funds futures 
contracts. When the US central bank began its rate hiking cycle in 2015, it declared 
an intention to maintain a 25 bp “target range” (lower and upper bounds) for the 
federal funds rate. The Fed regularly communicates its “forward guidance” along with 
the so-called dot plot, which shows where each FOMC meeting participant believes 
the federal funds rate should be at the end of the year, for the next few years, and in 
the longer run.
To derive probabilities of potential upcoming Fed interest rate actions, market par -
ticipants look at the pricing of fed funds futures, which are tied to the effective federal 
funds (FFE) rate —the rate actually transacted between depository institutions—not the 
Fed’s target federal funds rate. The underlying assumption is that the implied futures 
market rates are predicting the value of the monthly average effective federal funds 
rate. As shown in Exhibit 9 , where the dots represent forecasts of the federal funds 
rate by each FOMC member, implied market expectations (dotted line) can diverge 
significantly from the Fed’s forward guidance (solid line, the median of the dots).

Using Derivatives to Infer Market Expectations 121
Fed funds futures are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade, and the contract price is 
quoted as 100 minus the market’s expectation for the FFE rate, as follows:
 Fed funds futures contract price = 100 − Expected FFE rate. (17)
At expiration, the contract is cash settled to the simple average (overnight) effective 
federal funds rate for the delivery month. The overnight rate is calculated and reported 
daily by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
To determine the probability of a change in the federal funds rate, the following 
formula is used, where the current federal funds rate is the midpoint of the current 
target range:
    Effective federal funds rate implied by futures contract  − Current federal funds rate       __________________________________________________________       Federal funds rate assuming a rate hike  − C urrent federal funds rate    (18)
Inferring Market Expectations
Andrew Okyung manages a portfolio of short-term floating-rate corporate debt, and 
he is interested in understanding current market expectations for any Fed rate actions 
at the upcoming FOMC meeting. He observes that the current price for the fed funds 
futures contract expiring after the next FOMC meeting is 97.90. The current federal 
funds rate target range is set between 1.75% and 2.00%.
Demonstrate how Okyung can use the information provided to determine the 
following:
1. The expected average FFE rate
2. The probability of a 25 bp interest rate hike at the next FOMC meeting
Solution to 1:
The FFE rate implied by the futures contract price is 2.10% (= 100 − 97.90). Okyung 
understands that this is the rate that market participants expect to be the average 
federal funds rate for that month.
Solution to 2:
Okyung knows that given that the FFE rate embedded in the fed funds futures price is 
2.10%, there is a high probability that the FOMC will increase rates by 25 bps from its 
current target range of 1.75%–2.00% to the new target range of 2.00%–2.25%. Given 
the Fed’s declared incremental move size of 25 bps, he calculates the probability of 
a rate hike as
    2.100  %  − 1.875 %  _____________   2.125  %  − 1.875 %   = 0.90,  or 90% 
where 1.875% is the midpoint of the current target range (1.75%–2.00%) and 2.125% 
is the midpoint of the new target range (2.00%–2.25%) assuming a rate hike.
Exhibit 10  displays, as a hypothetical example, the trends in implied probabilities 
(y-axis) derived from fed funds futures prices of an FOMC rate action—either a 25 bp 
rate hike, a 25 bp rate cut, or no change—at the next FOMC meeting date. Note that 
the probability of a rate hike or cut is represented as the probability of a move from 
the current target range at the specified meeting date, and of course, the probabilities 
of all three actions at a particular meeting date sum to 1.

Importantly, typical end-of-month (EOM) activity by large financial and banking 
institutions often induces “dips” in the FFE rate that create bias issues when using 
the rate as the basis for probability calculations of potential FOMC rate moves. For 
example, if such activity increased the price for the relevant fed funds futures contract 
to 98.05, then the FFE rate would decline to 1.95% (= 100 − 98.05). In this case, using 
the same equation as before, the probability of an FOMC rate hike decreases from 
90% to just 30%:
    1.950  − 1.875 _  0.25   = 0.30,  or 30% 
To overcome this end-of-month bias, data providers have implemented various methods 
of “smoothing” the EOM dips. One prominent data provider uses a method that builds 
a forward rate structure based on where the market believes interest rates will settle 
in non-FOMC meeting months and then uses these forward rates to make appropri -
ate adjustments. For each FOMC meeting month, it is assumed that an effective rate 
prevails until the meeting date, and then some rate prevails after the meeting, with 
the average effective rate over the month being implied by the futures price.
SUMMARY
This reading on swap, forward, and futures strategies shows a number of ways in which 
market participants might use these derivatives to enhance returns or to reduce risk 
to better meet portfolio objectives. Following are the key points.
 ■Interest rate, currency, and equity swaps, forwards, and futures can be used 
to modify risk and return by altering the characteristics of the cash flows of 
an investment portfolio.
 ■An interest rate swap is an OTC contract in which two parties agree to 
exchange cash flows on specified dates, one based on a floating interest rate 
and the other based on a fixed rate (swap rate), determined at swap initi -
ation. Both rates are applied to the swap’s notional value to determine the 
size of the payments, which are typically netted. Interest rate swaps enable a 
party with a fixed (floating) risk or obligation to effectively convert it into a 
floating (fixed) one.
Using Derivatives to Infer Market Expectations 123
 ■Investors can use short-dated interest rate futures and forward rate agree -
ments or longer-dated fixed-income (bond) futures contracts to modify 
their portfolios’ interest rate risk exposure.
 ■When hedging interest rate risk with bond futures, one must determine the 
basis point value of the portfolio to be hedged, the target basis point value, 
and the basis point value of the futures, which itself is determined by the 
basis point value of the cheapest-to-deliver bond and its conversion factor. 
The number of bond futures to buy or sell to reach the target basis point 
value is then determined by the basis point value hedge ratio: 
  BPVHR =    (    BP  V  T   − BP  V  P    ___________  BP  V  CTD     )     × CF . 
 ■Cross-currency basis swaps help parties in the swap to hedge against the 
risk of exchange rate fluctuations and to achieve better rate outcomes. Firms 
that need foreign-denominated cash can obtain funding in their local cur -
rency (likely at a more favorable rate) and then swap the local currency for 
the required foreign currency using a cross-currency basis swap.
 ■Equity risk in a portfolio can be managed using equity swaps and total 
return swaps. There are three main types of equity swap: (1) receive-equity 
return, pay-fixed; (2) receive-equity return, pay-floating; and (3) 
receive-equity return, pay-another equity return. A total return swap is a 
modified equity swap; it also includes in the performance any dividends paid 
by the underlying stocks or index during the period until the swap maturity.
 ■Equity risk in a portfolio can also be managed using equity futures and 
forwards. Equity futures are standardized, exchange-listed contracts, and 
when the underlying is a stock index, only cash settlement is available at 
contract expiration. The number of equity futures contracts to buy or sell is 
determined by 
   N  f   =    (     β  T   −  β  S   _  β  f     )       (    S _ F   )     . 
 ■Cash equitization is a strategy designed to boost returns by finding ways to 
“equitize” unintended cash holdings. It is typically done using stock index 
futures and interest rate futures.
 ■Derivatives on volatility include VIX futures and options and variance 
swaps. Importantly, VIX option prices are determined from VIX futures, 
and both instruments allow an investor to implement a view depending on 
her expectations about the timing and magnitude of a change in implied 
volatility.
 ■In a variance swap, the buyer of the contract will pay the difference between 
the fixed variance strike specified in the contract and the realized variance 
(annualized) on the underlying over the period specified and applied to a 
variance notional. Thus, variance swaps allow directional bets on implied 
versus realized volatility.
 ■Derivatives can be used to infer market participants’ current expectations 
for changes over the short term in inflation (e.g., CPI swaps) and market 
volatility (e.g., VIX futures). Another common application is using fed funds 
futures prices to derive the probability of a central bank move in the federal 
funds rate target at the FOMC’s next meeting.

PRACTICE PROBLEMS
1. A European bond portfolio manager wants to increase the modified duration of 
his €30 million portfolio from 3 to 5. She would most likely  enter a receive-fixed 
interest rate swap that has principal notional of €20 million and:
A. a modified duration of 2.
B. a modified duration of 3.
C. a modified duration of 4.
The following information relates to questions 
2-8
Global Mega (Global) is a diversified financial services firm. Yasuko Regan, senior 
trader, and Marcus Whitacre, junior trader, both work on the firm’s derivatives 
desk. Regan and Whitacre assist in structuring and implementing trades for 
clients in the financial services industry that have limited derivatives expertise. 
Regan and Whitacre are currently assisting one of Global’s clients—Monatize, an 
asset management firm—with two of its portfolios: Portfolio A and Portfolio B.
Portfolio A is a bond portfolio composed solely of US Treasury bonds. Monatize 
has asked Global to quote the number of Treasury futures contracts necessary 
to fully hedge this bond portfolio against a rise in interest rates. Exhibit 1 pres -
ents selected data on Portfolio A, the relevant Treasury futures contract, and the 
cheapest-to-deliver (CTD) bond. 
Exhibit 1: Selected Data on Portfolio A, the Treasury Futures Contract, and 
the CTD Bond
Portfolio A Futures Contract and CTD Bond
Market value $143,234,000 Price 145.20
Modified duration 9.10 Modified duration 8.75
Basis point value $130,342.94 Basis point value $127.05
    Conversion factor 0.72382
    Contract size $100,000
After an internal discussion, Monatize elects to not hedge Portfolio A but rather 
decrease the portfolio’s modified duration to 3.10. Regan asks Whitacre to 
compute the number of Treasury futures contracts to sell in order to achieve this 
objective. Regan tells Whitacre to assume the yield curve is flat.
Portfolio B is a $100,000,000 equity portfolio indexed to the S&P 500 Index, with 
excess cash of $4,800,000. Monatize is required to equitize its excess cash to be 
fully invested, and the firm directs Global to purchase futures contracts to do so. 
To replicate the return of Portfolio B’s target index, Whitacre purchases S&P 500 
futures contracts, at a price of 3,300 per contract, that have a multiplier of $250 
per index point and a beta of 1.00.
Monatize’s CFO and Regan discuss two potential hedging strategies for Portfolio 
Practice Problems 125
B to protect against a hypothetical extreme sell-off in equities. Regan first sug -
gests that Monatize could enter into a total return equity swap, whereby Mon -
atize agrees to pay the return on the S&P 500 and receive a fixed interest rate at 
pre-specified dates in exchange for a fee.
Regan next suggests that Monatize could alternatively hedge Portfolio B using 
variance swaps. Monatize’s CFO asks Regan to calculate what the gain would be 
in five months on a purchase of $1,000,000 vega notional of a one-year variance 
swap on the S&P 500 at a strike of 15% (quoted as annual volatility), assuming the 
following:
 ■Over the next five months, the S&P 500 experiences a realized volatility of 
20%;
 ■At the end of the five-month period, the fair strike of a new seven-month 
variance swap on the S&P 500 will be 18%; and
 ■The annual interest rate is 1.50%.
Regan and Whitacre discuss the use of federal funds futures contracts to infer 
probabilities of future monetary policy changes. Whitacre makes the following 
three statements about fed funds futures contracts:
Statement 1 Typical end-of-month activity by large financial and banking 
institutions often induces “dips” in the effective fed funds rate.
Statement 2 Especially for the longer-term horizon, the probabilities inferred 
from the pricing of fed funds futures usually have strong predic -
tive power.
Statement 3 To derive probabilities of Federal Reserve interest rate actions, 
market participants look at the pricing of fed funds futures, 
which are tied to the Federal Reserve’s target fed funds rate.
Whitacre then proposes to Regan that Global explore opportunities in bond 
futures arbitrage. Whitacre makes the following two statements:
Statement 1 If the basis is positive, a trader would make a profit by “selling 
the basis. ”
Statement 2 If the basis is negative, a trader would make a profit by selling 
the bond and buying the futures. 
2. Based on Exhibit 1, the number of Treasury futures contracts Whitacre should 
sell to fully hedge Portfolio A is closest  to:
A. 650.
B. 743.
C. 1,026.
3. Based on Exhibit 1, the number of Treasury futures contracts Whitacre should 
sell to achieve Monetize’s objective with respect to Portfolio A is closest  to:
A. 490.
B. 518.
C. 676.

B. 121.
C. 1,455.
5. The derivative product first suggested by Regan as a potential hedge strategy for 
Portfolio B:
A. is a relatively liquid contract.

Canawacta Tioga is the CFO for Wyalusing Corporation, a multinational manu -
facturing company based in Canada. One year ago, Wyalusing issued fixed-rate 
coupon bonds in Canada. Tioga now expects Canadian interest rates to fall and 
remain low for three years. During this three-year period, Tioga wants to use a

orphaned and injured sloths from the rain forest in the country of Lushland. The 
organization is supported by both domestic and international contributions. The 
Sanctuary’s CFO typically invests any funds that are not immediately needed for 
short-term operational expenses into a domestic index fund that tracks the Lush -
land 100 stock index, which is denominated in Lushland dollars (LLD).
The Sanctuary just received a large contribution from a local benefactor in the 
amount of LLD1,000,000. These funds are not needed for short-term operational 
expenses. The CFO intends to equitize this excess cash position using futures 
contracts to replicate the return on the Lushland 100 stock index. Exhibit 1 
shows selected data for the Lushland 100 Index futures contract.

18. Determine the appropriate number of futures contracts that the CFO should buy 
to equitize the excess cash position.
19. A Japanese benefactor recently donated a plot of land in Japan to the Sanctuary. 
Ownership of the land has been transferred to the Sanctuary, which has a binding 
contract to sell the property for JPY500,000,000. The property sale will be com -
pleted in 30 days. The Sanctuary’s CFO wants to hedge the risk of JPY deprecia -
tion using futures contracts. The CFO assumes a hedge ratio of 1.
Describe a strategy to implement the CFO’s desired hedge.
20. An equity portfolio manager is invested 100% in US large-cap stocks, but he 
wants to reduce the current allocation by 20%, to 80%, and allocate 20% to US 
small caps. He decides not to sell the stocks because of the high transaction costs. 
Rather, he will use S&P 500 Index futures and Russell 2000 Index futures for 
achieving the desired exposure in, respectively, US large caps and small caps. To 
achieve the new allocation, he will for an equivalent of 20% of the portfolio value:
A. purchase Russell 2000 futures only.
B. purchase Russell 2000 futures and sell S&P 500 futures.
C. sell Russell 2000 futures and purchase S&P 500 futures.
21. A volatility trader observes that the VIX term structure is upward sloping. In 
particular, the VIX is at 13.50, the front-month futures contract trades at 14.10, 
and the second-month futures contract trades at 15.40. Assuming the shape of 
the VIX term structure will remain constant over the next three-month period, 
the trader decides to implement a trade that would profit from the VIX carry roll 
down. She will most likely purchase the:
A. VIX and sell the VIX second-month futures.
B. VIX and sell the VIX front-month futures.
C. VIX front-month futures and sell the VIX second-month futures.
22. The CEO of a corporation owns 100 million shares of his company’s stock, which 
is currently priced at €30 a share. Given the huge exposure of his personal wealth 
to this one company, he has decided to sell 10% of his position and invest the 
funds in a floating interest rate instrument. A derivatives dealer suggests that he 
do so using an equity swap.
Explain how to structure such a swap.
23. A $30 million investment account of a bank trust fund is allocated one-third 
to stocks and two-thirds to bonds. The portfolio manager wants to change the 
overall allocation to 50% stock and 50% bonds and the allocation within the stock 
fund from 70% domestic stock and 30% foreign stock to 60% domestic and 40% 
foreign. The bond allocation will remain entirely invested in domestic corporate

issues.
Explain how swaps can be used to implement this adjustment. The market 
reference rate is assumed to be flat for all swaps, and you do not need to refer to 
specific stock and bond indexes.
24. Sarah Ko, a private wealth adviser in Singapore, is developing a short-term 
interest rate forecast for her private wealth clients who have holdings in the US 
fixed-income markets. Ko needs to understand current market expectations for 
possible upcoming central bank (i.e., US Federal Reserve Board) rate actions. The 
current price for the fed funds futures contract expiring after the next FOMC 
meeting is 97.175. The current federal funds rate target range is set between 
2.50% and 2.75%.
Explain how Ko can use this information to understand potential movements in 
the federal funds rate. Calculate the probability of an increase of 25 bps in the 
target range.

SOLUTIONS
1. B is correct. The portfolio manager’s goal is to use the receive-fixed, pay-floating 
swap such that the €30 million of bonds, with modified duration of 3, and the 
€20 million swap will combine to make up a portfolio with a market value of €30 
million and modified duration of 5. This relationship can be expressed as follows:
 €30,000,000(3) + ( NS × MDURS) = €30,000,000(5).
Given the swap’s notional ( NS) of €20,000,000, its required modified duration can 
be obtained as:
 MDURS = [(5 – 3)€30,000,000]/€20,000,000 = 3.
2. B is correct. The basis point value of Portfolio A ( BPVP) is $130,342.94, and the 
basis point value of the cheapest-to-deliver bond ( BPVCTD) is $127.05 with a 
conversion factor of 0.72382. The basis point value hedge ratio ( BPVHR ), in the 
special case of complete hedging, provides the number of futures contracts need -
ed, calculated as follows:
  BPVHR =   − BP  V  P   _ BP  V  CTD     × CF =   − $130, 342.94 ___________  $127.05   × 0.72382  = − 742.58  
Therefore, Whitacre should sell 743 Treasury bond futures to fully hedge Portfo -
lio A.
A is incorrect because it incorrectly uses the price of the cheapest-to-deliver 
bond (rather than its basis point value, BPVCTD) in the denominator of the 
BPVHR  calculation:
  BPVHR =   − BP  V  P   ____________   CTD Bond Price   × CF =   − $130, 342.94 ___________  $145.20   × 0.72382  = − 649.76  
C is incorrect because it does not include the conversion factor for the 
cheapest-to-deliver bond when calculating BPVHR :
  BPVHR =   − BP  V  P   _ BP  V  CTD     =   − $130, 342.94 ___________  $127.05   = − 1, 025.92  
3. A is correct. Monetize wants to reduce Portfolio A’s modified duration to a target 
of 3.10. BPVT is calculated as follows:
  BP  V  T   = MDU  R  T   × 0.01% × M  V  P   
  BP  V  T   =    (  3.10 )     × 0.0001  × $143, 234, 000 = $44, 402.54  
The basis point value of Portfolio A ( BPVP) is $130,342.94, and the basis point 
value of the cheapest-to-deliver bond ( BPVCTD) is $127.05 with a conversion 
factor of 0.72382. The basis point value hedge ratio ( BPVHR ), which provides the 
number of futures contracts needed, is then calculated as follows:
  BPVHR =   BP  V  T   − BP  V  P    ___________  BP  V  CTD     × CF 
  BPVHR =   $44, 402.54  − $130, 342.94  ___________________   $127.05   × 0.72382  = − 489.6134  
Thus, to decrease the modified duration of Portfolio A to 3.10, Whitacre should 
sell 490 Treasury bond futures contracts.
B is incorrect because it incorrectly subtracts 6.00 from the modified duration 
(equal to 9.10 – 3.10, or the change in the modified duration for Portfolio A) of 
Solutions 133
the cheapest-to-deliver bond, rather than from the modified duration of the bond 
portfolio, in computing BPVT.
  BP  V  T   =    (  8.75 − 6.00 )     × 0.0001  × $143, 234, 000 = $39, 389.35  
This error results in an incorrect calculation of BPVHR :
  BPVHR =   $39, 389.35  − $130, 342.94  ___________________   $127.05   × 0.72382  = − 518.1741  
C is incorrect because it does not include the conversion factor for the 
cheapest-to-deliver bond when calculating BPVHR :
  BPVHR =   $44, 402.54  − $130, 342.94  ___________________   $127.05   = − 676.4298  
4. A is correct. The number of equity index futures contracts to purchase in order 
to equitize Monatize’s excess cash position is calculated as follows:
   N  f   =    (     β  T   _  β  f     )       (    S _ F   )     =    (    1.00 _ 1.00   )       (    $4, 800, 000 _ $825, 000   )     = 5.82, or 6 contracts  
The actual futures contract purchase value of $825,000 is the product of the 
quoted S&P 500 futures price of 3,300 and the designated multiplier of $250 per 
index point.
B is incorrect because $100,000,000, the total value of Portfolio B, is incorrectly 
used as the market value of the stock portfolio to equitize ( S), instead of Portfolio 
B’s excess cash position:
   N  f   =    (     β  T   _  β  f     )       (    S _ F   )     =    (    1.00 _ 1.00   )       (    $100, 000, 000 _  $825, 000   )     = 121.21 , or 121 contracts  
C is incorrect because 3,300, the quoted S&P 500 futures price, is incorrectly 
used as the actual futures contract price, instead of calculating the actual futures 
contract price of $825,000:
   N  f   =    (     β  T   _  β  f     )       (    S _ F   )     =    (    1.00 _ 1.00   )       (    $4, 800, 000 _  $3, 300   )     = 1, 454.54 , or 1,455 contracts  
5. C is correct. The first hedging strategy suggested by Regan is entering into a 
total return equity swap in exchange for a fee. Equity swaps, which are relatively 
illiquid contracts and are OTC derivative instruments in which each party bears 
counterparty risk, do not confer voting rights to the counterparty receiving the 
performance of the underlying. Under the terms of the total return equity swap, 
at pre-specified dates, the counterparties will net the index total return (increase/
decrease plus dividends) against the fixed interest payment. If the index total 
return exceeds the fixed interest payment, Monatize will pay the counterparty the 
net payment. If the index total return is less than the fixed interest payment, then 
Monatize will receive the net payment from the counterparty.
A is incorrect because equity swaps are relatively illiquid contracts.
B is incorrect because equity swaps are OTC derivative instruments, and each 
counterparty in the equity swap bears the risk exposure to the other counter -
party. For this reason, equity swaps are usually collateralized in order to reduce 
credit risk exposure.
6. A is correct. The gain on the variance swap is calculated as:
   VarSwa  p  t   = Variance Notional × P  V  t     (  T )    
       ×    {    t _ T   ×   [  RealizedVol   (  0, t )     ]     2  +   T − t _ T   ×   [  ImpliedVol   (  t, T )     ]     2  − Strik  e   2  }      
Values for the inputs are as follows:
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 134
Volatility strike on existing swap = 15
Variance strike on existing swap = 152 = 225
  Variance Notional =   Vega Notional  ___________  2 × Strike   =   $1, 000, 000 _  2 × 15   = $33, 333.33  
 RealizedV ol(0, t)2 = 202 = 400
 ImpliedV ol( t,T)2= 182 = 324
 t = 5
 T = 12
  P  V  t     (  T )     =   1 _______________   
1 +    [  1.50 %    (    7 _ 12   )     ]       = 0.991326 , 
which is the present value interest factor after five months (i.e., discounting for 
seven remaining months, from t to T), where the annual interest rate is 1.50%.
Thus, the value of the swap in five months is calculated as follows:
   VarSwa  p  t   = $33, 333.33  × 0.991326  ×    {    5 _ 12   × 400 +   12 − 5 _ 12   × 324 − 225 }    
        = $4, 317, 774.59   
    
Given that Monatize would be long the swap, the mark-to-market value would be 
positive (i.e., a gain) for Monatize, equal to $4,317,775.
B is incorrect because the value of the variance swap in five months incorrectly 
omits the present value interest factor of 0.991326.
The value of the swap in five months, incorrectly omitting the present value inter -
est factor, is calculated as follows:
  VarSwa  p  t   = $33, 333.33  ×    {    5 _ 12   × 400 +   12 − 5 _ 12   × 324 − 225 }     = $4, 355, 555.56  
C is incorrect because the values of [ RealizedVol (0,t)]2 and [ ImpliedVol (t,T)]2 are 
incorrectly switched. 
The value of the swap in five months, incorrectly switching the values of [ Real -
izedVo l(0,t)]2 and [ ImpliedVol (t,T)]2, is calculated as follows:
  VarSwa  p  t   = $33, 333.33  × 0.991326  ×    (    5 _ 12   × 324 +   12 − 5 _ 12   × 400 − 225 )    
 = $4, 736, 334.37  
7. A is correct. Typical end-of-month (EOM) activity by large financial and bank -
ing institutions often induces “dips” in the effective federal funds (FFE) rate that 
create bias issues when using the rate as the basis for probability calculations of 
potential Federal Open Market Committee rate moves. If EOM activity increas -
es the price for the relevant fed funds contract, the FFE rate would decline. A 
decline in the FFE rate would decrease the probability of a change in the fed 
funds rate. To overcome this EOM bias, data providers have implemented various 
methods of “smoothing” EOM dips. 
Statement 2 is incorrect because the probabilities inferred from the pricing of 
fed funds futures usually do not have strong predictive power, especially for the 
longer-term horizon. 
Statement 3 is incorrect because, to derive probabilities of Fed interest rate ac -
tions, market participants look at the pricing of fed funds futures, which are tied 
to the FFE rate—that is, the rate used in actual transactions between depository 
institutions, not the Fed’s target fed funds rate. 
Solutions 135
B is incorrect because the probabilities inferred from the pricing of fed funds fu -
tures usually do not have strong predictive power, especially for the longer-term 
horizon.
C is incorrect because, to derive probabilities of Fed interest rate actions, market 
participants look at the pricing of fed funds futures, which are tied to the FFE 
rate—that is, the rate that depository institutions actually use for lending to each 
other, not the Fed’s target federal funds rate. The underlying assumption is that 
the implied futures market rates are predicting the value of the monthly average 
FFE rate.
8. A is correct. If the basis is positive, a trader would make a profit by “selling the 
basis”—that is, selling the bond and buying the futures. In contrast, when the 
basis is negative, the trader would make a profit by “buying the basis, ” in which 
the trader would purchase the bond and short the futures.
B is incorrect because Statement 5 is incorrect. If the basis is negative, a trader 
would make a profit by “buying the basis”—that is, purchasing (not selling) the 
bond and shorting (not buying) the futures. 
C is incorrect because Statement 5 is incorrect. If the basis is negative, a trader 
would make a profit by “buying the basis”—that is, purchasing (not selling) the 
bond and shorting (not buying) the futures. 
9. A is correct. The portfolio manager would most likely use a longer-dated 
fixed-income (bond) futures contract to hedge his interest rate risk exposure. 
The choice of the hedging instrument, in fact, will depend on the maturity of the 
bond being hedged. Interest rate futures, like 90-day Eurodollar futures, have a 
limited number of maturities and can be used to hedge short-term bonds. The 
mark-to-market value of a receive-fixed 10-year interest rate swap will become 
negative if interest rates rises, and thus the swap cannot be used as a hedge in this 
case.
10. B is correct. The CIO sells the relevant interest rate future contracts at 98.05. 
After six months, the CIO initiates the bridge loan at a rate of 2.70%, but he un -
winds the hedge at the lower futures price of 97.30, thus gaining 75 bps (= 98.05 
– 97.30). The effective interest rate on the loan is 1.95% (= 2.70% – 0.75%).
11. The number of equity index futures contracts required to achieve the target port -
folio beta of 1.2 is calculated as follows:
    N  f   =    (     β  T   −  β  S   _  β  f     )       (    S _ F   )    
    N  f   =    (    1.2 − 0.9 _ 1.0   )       (    €168, 300, 000 _  €45, 000   )        
 N  f   = 1, 122   
Because the number of futures contracts ( Nf) is positive, Uff should buy 1,122 
equity index futures contracts.
12. The swap notional principal required to achieve the target portfolio modified 
duration is calculated as follows:
    N  S   =    (    MDU  R  T   − MDU  R  P    ______________  MDU  R  S     )       (  M  V  P   )    
     N  S   =    (    5.0000  − 7.8000  ____________  − 2.4848   )       (  €90, 100, 000 )         
 N  S   = €101, 529, 298.13   
Therefore, Uff should enter into the selected three-year par pay-fixed, 
receive-floating interest rate swap with a notional principal of approximately 
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 136
€101,529,298.
13. Uff needs to reduce the equity allocation by €13,202,500 (= €201,384,000 
– €188,181,500).
The number of equity index futures contracts required to rebalance the Fund’s 
portfolio to the target allocation is calculated as follows:
   N  f   =    (     β  T   −  β  S   _  β  f     )       (    S _ F   )     
Uff needs to move to a notional “cash” position (βT = 0) to reduce equity ex -
posure, and the portfolio beta is βS = 1.28. The beta of the equity index futures 
contract (βf) is 1.00, so the number of equity index futures contracts required is 
calculated as follows:
    N  f   =    (    0.00 − 1.28 _  1.00   )       (    €13, 202, 500 _  €35, 000   )        
 N  f   = − 482.83   
Because the number of futures contracts ( Nf) is negative, Uff should sell 483 equi -
ty index futures contracts (after rounding).
Uff needs to increase the bond allocation by €13,202,500 (= €101,328,500 
– €88,126,000).
The number of bond futures contracts required to rebalance the Fund’s portfolio 
to the target allocation is calculated as follows:
  BPVHR =    (    BP  V  T   − BP  V  P    ___________  BP  V  CTD     )     × CF, 
where
   BP  V  T   = MDU  R  T   × 0.01 %  × M  V  P  
    BP  V  T   = 4.59 × 0.0001  × €13, 202, 500     
BP  V  T   = €6, 059.95   
 Now, starting with a notional “cash” position ( BPVP = 0) provided by the re -
duction in equity exposure above, and noting that BPVCTD = €91.26 and CF = 
0.733194, the number of bond futures contracts is calculated as follows:
   BPVHR =    (    €6, 059.95  − €0.00  _____________  €91.26   )     × 0.733194     
BPVHR = 48.69   
Because the BPVHR is positive, Uff should buy 49 bond futures contracts (after 
rounding).
14. Explain how to construct the swap that Tioga wants to use with regard to the 
swap:
i. The swap tenor will be three years, consistent with the length of time for 
which Tioga expects interest rates to remain low.
ii. Tioga will establish an interest rate swap in which Wyalusing will make 
payments based on a floating reference rate and will receive payments 
based on a fixed rate. The source of the reference rate and the value of the 
fixed rate will be set at the time of the swap’s inception. The net effect for 
Wyalusing of the combination of making fixed payments on its coupon 
bond, receiving fixed payments on the swap, and making floating pay -
ments on the swap is to convert the fixed obligations of its bond coupon 
payments into floating-rate-based obligations. This scenario will allow 
Wyalusing to benefit if Tioga’s expectation of low interest rates is realized.
Solutions 137
iii. The notional value of the swap should be set such that the fixed pay -
ments that Wyalusing receives will equal the fixed coupon payments that 
Wyalusing must make on its fixed-rate bond obligations.
iv. Swap settlement dates should be set on the same days as the fixed-rate 
bond’s coupon payment dates.
15. Describe how the swap will function, from the perspective of Wyalusing, in terms 
of the:
i. At inception, Wyalusing will pay the notional principal of CAD and will 
receive an amount of USD according to the USD/CAD exchange rate, 
agreed to at inception.
ii. At each swap payment date, Wyalusing will receive interest in CAD and 
will pay interest in USD. Both payments are based on floating reference 
rates for their respective currencies. The CAD rate will also include a basis 
rate that is quoted separately. On each settlement date, Wyalusing will 
receive an amount of CAD based on the CAD floating rate minus the basis 
rate applied to the swap notional value, and it will pay an amount of USD 
based on the USD floating rate and the USD/CAD exchange rate that was 
set at inception.
iii. At maturity, Wyalusing will receive the notional principal of CAD and will 
pay an amount of USD according to the USD/CAD exchange rate that was 
set at inception, applied to the CAD notional principal. The cash flows at 
maturity are the inverses of the cash flows at inception. 
16. C is correct. In a cross-currency basis swap, the goals of the transaction are to 
achieve favorable funding and exchange rates and to swap the foreign currency 
amounts back to the currency of choice—in this case, the US dollar—at maturity. 
There is one exchange rate specified in the swap that is used to determine the 
notional principals in the two currencies, exchanged at inception and at maturity.
17. B is correct. By hedging the position in Italian government bonds with the 
cross-currency basis swap, the US investor will most likely increase the periodic 
net interest she receives in US dollars. The reason is that the periodic net interest 
payments made by the swap counterparty to the investor will include the positive 
basis resulting from the relatively strong demand for US dollars versus euros.
18. The Lushland 100 Index futures contract value is calculated as the quoted futures 
price multiplied by the designated contract multiplier:
   F = 1, 247 × LLD200   F = LLD249, 400   
The target beta is the index beta, which equals 1.00. The number of Lushland 100 
Index futures contracts that the Sanctuary must buy to equitize its excess cash 
position is calculated as follows:
    N  f   =    (     β  T   _  β  f     )       (    S _ F   )    
    N  f   =    (    1 _ 1   )       (    LLD1, 000, 000  ___________ LLD249, 400   )        
 N  f   = 4.01 (rounded to 4)   
Therefore, the CFO should buy four Lushland 100 Index futures contracts to 
equitize the excess cash position.
Learning Module 2 Swaps, Forwards, and Futures Strategies 138
19. The Sanctuary’s CFO can use currency futures contracts to lock in the current 
LLD/JPY exchange rate. The CFO can hedge the Sanctuary’s exchange rate risk 
by selling JPY futures contracts with the closest expiry to the expected future 
JPY inflow. When the futures contracts expire, the Sanctuary will receive (pay) 
any depreciation (appreciation) in JPY relative to LLD (when compared with the 
original LLD/JPY futures contract price). The CFO can determine the number 
of contracts needed by dividing the property’s sale price of JPY500,000,000 by 
the JPY futures contract value. Because the hedge ratio is assumed to equal 1, 
the changes in futures and spot prices will be equal during the life of the futures 
contract, and so the hedge will be fully effective.
20. B is correct. To reduce the current allocation by 20%, to 80%, in US large-cap 
stocks, the portfolio manager will sell S&P 500 futures. At the same time, to allo -
cate this 20% to US small caps, he will purchase Russell 2000 futures for the same 
notional amount.
21. C is correct. VIX futures converge to the spot VIX as expiration approaches, and 
the two must be equal at expiration. When the VIX futures curve is in contango 
and assuming volatility remains stable, the VIX futures will get “pulled” closer 
to the spot VIX, and they will decrease in price as they approach expiration. 
Traders calculate the difference between the front-month VIX futures price and 
the VIX as 0.60, and the spread between the front-month and the second-month 
futures is 1.30. Assuming that the spread declines linearly until settlement, the 
trader would realize roll-down gains as the spread decreases from 1.30 to 0.60 
as the front-month futures approaches its expiration. At expiration, VIX futures 
are equal to the VIX, and the spread with the old second-month (and now the 
front-month) futures contract will be 0.60. Finally, since one cannot directly in -
vest in the VIX, trades focusing on the VIX term structure must be implemented 
using either VIX futures or VIX options, so Answers A and B are not feasible.
22. The swap is structured such that the executive pays the return on 10 million 
shares of the company’s stock, which is 10% of his holdings, and he receives the 
return based on a floating interest rate, such as the market reference rate, on a 
notional principal of €300 million (= €30/share × 10 million shares).
23. Currently the allocation is $10 million in stocks and $20 million in bonds. Within 
the stock category, the current allocation is $7 million domestic and $3 million 
foreign. The desired allocation is $15 million in stocks and $15 million in bonds. 
Thus, the allocation must change by moving $5 million into stocks and out of 
bonds. The desired stock allocation is $9 million domestic and $6 million foreign. 
The desired bond allocation is $15 million, all domestic corporate.
To make the changes with swaps, the manager must enter into swaps against the 
market reference rate, which is assumed to be flat for all swaps in this example. 
Using the swaps, the bank trust fund portfolio manager needs to (1) receive the 
returns on $2 million based on a domestic equity index and on $3 million based 
on a foreign equity index and (2) pay the return on $5 million based on a domes -
tic corporate bond index. The market reference rate outflows from the swaps in 
(1) and the inflows from the swap in (2) will cancel out through summation.
24. First, Ko knows that the FFE rate implied by the futures contract price of 97.175 
is 2.825% (= 100 – 97.175). This is the rate that market participants expect to be 
the average federal funds rate for that month.
Second, Ko should determine the probability of a rate change. She knows the 
2.825% FFE rate implied by the futures signals a fairly high chance that the 
FOMC will increase rates by 25 bps from its current target range of 2.50%–2.75% 
to the new target range of 2.75%–3.00%. She calculates the probability of a rate

hike as follows:
    2.825  %  − 2.625 %  _____________   2.875  %  − 2.625 %   = 0.80,  or 80% 
Ko can now incorporate this probability of a Fed rate hike into her forecast of 
short-term US interest rates.

INTRODUCTION
Globalization has been one of the most persistent themes in recent history, and this 
theme applies equally to the world of finance. New investment products, deregulation, 
worldwide financial system integration, and better communication and information 
networks have opened new global investment opportunities. At the same time, investors 
have increasingly shed their “home bias” and sought investment alternatives beyond 
their own borders.1LEARNING MODULE

Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 142
The benefits of this trend for portfolio managers have been clear, both in terms 
of the broader availability of higher-expected-return investments as well as portfo -
lio diversification opportunities. Nonetheless, investments denominated in foreign 
currencies also bring a unique set of challenges: measuring and managing foreign 
exchange risk. Buying foreign-currency denominated assets means bringing currency 
risk into the portfolio. Exchange rates are volatile and, at least in the short to medium 
term, can have a marked impact on investment returns and risks— currency matters . 
The key to the superior performance of global portfolios is the effective management 
of this currency risk.
This reading explores basic concepts and tools of currency management. Section 2 
reviews some of the basic concepts of foreign exchange (FX) markets. The material in 
subsequent sections presumes an understanding of these concepts. Section 3 examines 
some of the basic mathematics involved in measuring the effects of foreign-currency 
investments on portfolio return and risk. Sections 4–6 discuss the strategic  decisions 
portfolio managers face in setting the target currency exposures of the portfolio. The 
currency exposures that the portfolio can accept range from a fully hedged position 
to active management of currency risk. Sections 7–8 discuss some of the tactical  con-
siderations involving active currency management if the investment policy statement 
(IPS) extends some latitude for active currency management. A requisite to any active 
currency management is having a market view; so these sections includes various 
methodologies by which a manager can form directional views on future exchange 
rate movements and volatility. Sections 9–12 cover a variety of trading tools available 
to implement both hedging and active currency management strategies. Although the 
generic types of FX derivatives tools are relatively limited—spot, forward, option, and 
swap contracts—the number of variations within each and the number of combinations 
in which they can be used is vast. Section 13 examines some of the issues involved in 
managing the currency exposures of emerging market currencies—that is, those that 
are less liquid than the major currencies.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONCEPTS
We begin with a review of the basic trading tools of the foreign exchange market: 
spot, forward, FX swap, and currency option transactions. The concepts introduced 
in this section will be used extensively in our discussion of currency management 
techniques in subsequent sections.
Most people think only of spot transactions when they think of the foreign exchange 
market, but in fact the spot market accounts for less than 40% of the average daily 
turnover in currencies.1 Although cross-border business  may be transacted in the 
spot market (making and receiving foreign currency payments), the risk management  
of these flows takes place in FX derivatives markets (i.e., using forwards, FX swaps, 
and currency options). So does the hedging of foreign currency assets and liabilities. 
It is unusual for market participants to engage in any foreign currency transactions 
without also managing the currency risk they create. Spot transactions typically gen -
erate derivative transactions. As a result, understanding these FX derivatives markets, 
and their relation to the spot market, is critical for understanding the currency risk 
management issues examined in this reading.

Foreign Exchange Concepts 143
Spot Markets
In professional FX markets, exchange rate quotes are described in terms of the 
three-letter currency codes used to identify individual currencies. Exhibit 1  shows a 
list of some of the more common currency codes.
Exhibit 1: Currency Codes
USD US dollar
EUR Euro
GBP British pound
JPY Japanese yen
MXN Mexican peso
CHF Swiss franc
CAD Canadian dollar
SEK Swedish krona
AUD Australian dollar
KRW Korean won
NZD New Zealand dollar
BRL Brazilian real
RUB Russian ruble
CNY Chinese yuan
INR Indian rupee
ZAR South African rand
An exchange rate is the number of units of one currency (called the price currency ) 
that one unit of another currency (called the base currency ) will buy. For example, in 
the notation we will use a USD/EUR rate of 1.1650 which means that one euro buys 
$1.1650; equivalently, the price of one euro is 1.1650 US dollars. Thus, the euro here 
is the base currency and the US dollar is the price currency. The exact notation used 
to represent exchange rates can vary widely between sources, and occasionally the 
same exchange rate notation will be used by different sources to mean completely 
different things. The reader should be aware that the notation used here may not be 
the same as that encountered elsewhere. To avoid confusion, this reading will identify 
exchange rates using the convention of “P/B, ” which refers to the price of one unit of 
the base currency “B” expressed in terms of the price currency “P . ” 
How the professional FX market quotes exchange rates—which is the base cur -
rency, and which is the price currency, in any currency pair—is not arbitrary but 
follows conventions that are broadly agreed on throughout the market. Generally, 
there is a hierarchy as to which currency will be quoted as the base currency in any 
given P/B currency pair:
1. Currency pairs involving the EUR will use the EUR as the base currency (for 
example, GBP/EUR).
2. Currency pairs involving the GBP , other than those involving the EUR, will 
use the GBP as the base currency (for example, CHF/GBP).
3. Currency pairs involving either the AUD or NZD, other than those involving 
either the EUR or GBP , will use these currencies as the base currency (for 
example, USD/AUD and NZD/AUD). The market convention between these 
two currencies is for a NZD/AUD quote.
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 144
4. All other currency quotes involving the USD will use USD as the base cur -
rency (for example, MXN/USD).
Readers are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the quoting conventions 
used in the professional FX market because they are the currency quotes that will be 
experienced in practice. Exhibit 2  lists some of the most commonly traded currency 
pairs in global FX markets and their market-standard quoting conventions. These 
market-standard conventions will be used for the balance of this reading.
Exhibit 2: Select Market-Standard Currency Pair Quotes
Quote convention Market name
USD/EUR Euro-dollar
GBP/EUR Euro-sterling
USD/GBP Sterling-dollar
JPY/USD Dollar-yen
USD/AUD Aussie-dollar
CHF/USD Dollar-Swiss
CAD/USD Dollar-Canada
JPY/EUR Euro-yen
CHF/EUR Euro-Swiss
JPY/GBP Sterling-yen
Another convention used in professional FX markets is that most spot currency quotes 
are priced out to four decimal places: for example, a typical USD/EUR quote would be 
1.1500 and not 1.15. The price point at the fourth decimal place is commonly referred 
to as a “pip. ” Professional FX traders also refer to what is called the “big figure” or the 
“handle, ” which is the integer to the left side of the decimal place as well as the first 
two decimal places of the quote. For example, for a USD/EUR quote of 1.1568, 1.15 
is the handle and there are 68 pips.
There are exceptions to this four decimal place rule. First, forward quotes—
discussed later—will often be quoted out to five and sometimes six decimal places. 
Second, because of the relative magnitude of some currency values, some currency 
quotes will only be quoted out to two decimal places. For example, because it takes 
many Japanese yen to buy one US dollar, the typical spot quote for JPY/USD is priced 
out to only two decimal places (for example, 111.35 and not 111.3500).2
The spot exchange rate is usually for settlement on the second business day after 
the trade date, referred to as T + 2 settlement.3 In foreign exchange markets—as in 
other financial markets—market participants confront a two-sided price in the form 
of a bid price and an offer price (also called an ask price) being quoted by potential 
counterparties. The bid price  is the price, defined in terms of the price currency, at 
which the counterparty providing a two-sided price quote is willing to buy one unit of 
the base  currency. Similarly, offer price  is the price, in terms of the price currency, at 
which that counterparty is willing to sell one unit of the base currency. For example, 
given a price request from a client, a dealer might quote a two-sided price on the 
spot USD/EUR exchange rate of 1.1648/1.1652. This quote means that the dealer is 
willing to pay USD1.1648 to buy one euro (bid) and that the dealer will sell one euro 
2 Many electronic dealing platforms in the FX market are moving to five decimal place pricing for spot 
quotes, using what are referred to as “deci-pips. ” In this case, for example, a USD/EUR spot quote might 
be shown as 1.37645. Spot quotes for JPY/USD on these systems will be given out to three decimal places.
3 The exception among the major currencies is CAD/USD, for which standard spot settlement is T + 1.
Foreign Exchange Concepts 145
(offer) for USD1.1652. The market width, usually referred to as dealer’s spread or the 
bid–offer spread, is the difference between the bid and the offer. When transacting on 
a dealer’s bid-offer two-sided price quote, a client is said to either “hit the bid” (selling 
the base currency) or “pay the offer” (buying the base currency).
An easy check to see whether the bid or offer should be used for a specific trans -
action is that the party asking  the dealer for a price should be on the more expensive 
side of the market. For example, if one wants to buy 1 EUR, 1.1652 is more USD per 
EUR than 1.1648. Hence, paying the offer involves paying more USD. Similarly, when 
selling 1 EUR, hitting the bid at 1.1648 means less USD received than 1.1652.
Forward Markets
Forward contracts are agreements to exchange one currency for another on a future 
date at an exchange rate agreed on today.4 In contrast to spot rates, forward contracts 
are any exchange rate transactions that occur with settlement longer than the usual 
T + 2 settlement for spot delivery.
In professional FX markets, forward exchange rates are typically quoted in terms 
of “points. ” The points on a forward rate quote are simply the difference between the 
forward exchange rate quote and the spot exchange rate quote; that is, the forward 
premium or discount, with the points scaled so that they can be related to the last 
decimal place in the spot quote. Forward points are adjustments to the spot price of 
the base currency, using our standard price/base (P/B) currency notation.
This means that forward rate quotes in professional FX markets are typically shown 
as the bid–offer on the spot rate and the number of forward points at each maturity.5 
For illustration purposes, assume that the bid–offer for the spot and forward points 
for the USD/EUR exchange rate are as shown in Exhibit 3 .
Exhibit 3: Sample Spot and Forward Quotes (Bid–Offer)
Maturity Spot Rate or Forward Points
Spot (USD/EUR) 1.1649/1.651
One month 5.1/5.6
Three months 25.3/25.9
Six months 46.0/46.7
Twelve months 92.3/93.8
To convert any of these quoted forward points into a forward rate, one would divide 
the number of points by 10,000 (to scale down to the fourth decimal place, the 
last decimal place in the USD/EUR spot quote) and then add the result to the spot 
exchange rate quote.6 But one must be careful about which side of the market (bid 
or offer) is being quoted. For example, suppose a market participant was selling  the 
EUR forward against the USD. Given the USD/EUR quoting convention, the EUR is 
the base currency. This means the market participant must use the bid rates (i.e., the 
market participant will “hit the bid”) given the USD/EUR quoting convention. Using 
the data in Exhibit 3 , the three-month forward bid rate in this case would be based 
on the bid for both the spot and the forward points, and hence would be:
4 These are sometimes called outright forwards to distinguish them from FX swaps, which are discussed later.
5 Maturity is defined in terms of the time between spot settlement, usually T + 2, and the settlement of 
the forward contract.
6 Because the JPY/USD exchange rate is only quoted to two decimal places, forward points for the dollar/
yen currency pair are divided by 100.
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 146
  1.1649  +    (    25.3 _ 10, 000   )     = 1.16743  
This result means that the market participant would be selling EUR three months 
forward at a price of USD1.1674 per EUR. Note that the quoted points are already 
scaled to each maturity—they are not annualized—so there is no need to adjust them.
Although there is no cash flow on a forward contract until settlement date, it is 
often useful to do a mark-to-market valuation on a forward position before then to 
(1) judge the effectiveness of a hedge based on forward contracts (i.e., by comparing 
the change in the mark-to-market of the underlying asset with the change in the 
mark-to-market of the forward), and (2) to measure the profitability of speculative 
currency positions at points before contract maturity.
As with other financial instruments, the mark-to-market value of forward contracts 
reflects the profit (or loss) that would be realized from closing out the position at cur -
rent market prices. To close out a forward position, it must be offset with an equal and 
opposite forward position using the spot exchange rate and forward points available 
in the market when the offsetting position is created. When a forward contract is 
initiated, the forward rate is such that no cash changes hands (i.e., the mark-to-market 
value of the contract at initiation is zero). From that moment onward, however, the 
mark-to-market value of the forward contract will change as the spot exchange rate 
changes as well as when interest rates change in either of the two currencies.
Consider an example. Suppose that a market participant bought GBP10,000,000 
for delivery against the AUD in six months at an “all-in” forward rate of 1.8600 AUD/
GBP . (The all-in forward rate is simply the sum of the spot rate and the forward points, 
appropriately scaled to size.) Three months later, the market participant wants to 
close out this forward contract. To do that would require selling GBP10,000,000 three 
months forward using the AUD/GBP spot exchange rate and forward points in effect 
at that time. Assume the bid–offer for spot and forward points three months prior to 
the settlement date are as follows:
Spot rate (AUD/GBP) 1.8810/1.8815  
Three-month points −4/−2  
To sell GBP (the base currency in the AUD/GBP quote) means calculating the bid 
side of the market. Hence, the appropriate all-in three-month forward rate to use is
 1.8810 + −4/10,000 = 1.8806
Thus, the market participant originally bought GBP10,000,000 at an AUD/GBP rate 
of 1.8600 and subsequently sold them at a rate of 1.8806. These GBP amounts will 
net to zero at settlement date (GBP10 million both bought and sold), but the AUD 
amounts will not net to zero because the forward rate has changed. The AUD cash 
flow at settlement date will be equal to
 (1.8806 − 1.8600) × 10,000,000 = AUD206,000
This amount is a cash inflow  because the market participant was long the GBP with 
the original forward position and the GBP subsequently appreciated (the AUD/GBP 
rate increased).
This cash flow is paid at settlement day, which is still three months away. To 
calculate the mark-to-market value on the dealer’s position, this cash flow must be 
discounted to the present. The present value of this amount is found by discounting 
the settlement day cash flow by the three-month discount rate. Because it is an AUD 
amount, the three-month AUD discount rate is used, proxied by the market reference 
rate (MRR). The rate enters the equation in annualized terms, 0.10%, and the present 
value of this future AUD cash flow is 
    AUD 206, 000  _____________   
1 + 0.0010    [    90 _ 360   ]       = AUD 205, 949 
Foreign Exchange Concepts 147
This is the mark-to-market value of the original long GBP10 million six-month 
forward contract when it is closed out three months prior to settlement.
To summarize, the process for marking-to-market a forward position is relatively 
straightforward:
1. Create an equal and offsetting forward position to the original forward posi -
tion. (In the example earlier, the market participant is long GBP10 million 
forward, so the offsetting forward contract would be to sell GBP10 million.)
2. Determine the appropriate all-in forward rate for this new, offsetting for -
ward position. If the base currency of the exchange rate quote is being sold 
(bought), then use the bid (offer) side of the market.
3. Calculate the cash flow at settlement day. This calculation will be based on 
the original contract size times the difference between the original forward 
rate and the rate calculated in Step 2. If the currency the market partici -
pant was originally long (short) subsequently appreciated (depreciated), 
then there will be a cash inflow . Otherwise, there will be a cash outflow. (In 
the earlier example, the market participant was long the GBP and it subse -
quently appreciated; this appreciation led to a cash inflow at the settlement 
day.)
4. Calculate the present value of this cash flow at the future settlement date. 
The currency of the cash flow and the discount rate must match. (In the 
example earlier, the cash flow at the settlement date is in AUD, so the mar -
ket reference rate (MRR) is used to calculate the present value.)
Finally, we note that in the example, the mark-to-market value is given in AUD. It 
would be possible to translate this AUD amount into any other currency value using 
the current spot rate for the relevant currency pair. In the example above, this would be 
done by redenominating the mark-to-market in USD, by selling 240,000 AUD 90-days 
forward against the USD at the prevailing USD/AUD 90-day forward bid rate. This will 
produce a USD cash flow in 90 days. This USD amount can then be present-valued at 
the 90-day US rate to get the USD mark-to-market value of the AUD/GBP forward 
position. The day-count convention used here is an “actual/360” basis.
FX Swap Markets
An FX swap transaction consists of offsetting and simultaneous spot and forward 
transactions, in which the base currency is being bought (sold) spot and sold (bought) 
forward. These two transactions are often referred to as the “legs” of the swap. The 
two legs of the swap can either be of equal size (a “matched” swap) or one can be 
larger than the other (a “mismatched” swap). FX swaps are distinct from currency 
swaps. Similar to currency swaps, FX swaps involve an exchange of principal amounts 
in different currencies at swap initiation that is reversed at swap maturity. Unlike 
currency swaps, FX swaps have no interim interest payments and are nearly always 
of much shorter term than currency swaps.
FX swaps are important for managing currency risk because they are used to 
“roll” forward contracts forward as they mature. For example, consider the case of a 
trader who bought  GBP1,000,000 one month forward against the CHF in order to set 
up a currency hedge. One month later, the forward contract will expire. To maintain 
this long position in the GBP against the CHF, two days prior to contract maturity, 
given T + 2 settlement, the trader must (1) sell GBP1,000,000 against the CHF spot, 
to settle the maturing forward contract; and (2) buy GBP1,000,000 against the CHF 
forward. That is, the trader is engaging in an FX swap (a matched swap in this case 
because the GBP currency amounts are equal).
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 148
If a trader wanted to adjust the size of the currency hedge (i.e., the size of the out -
standing forward position), the forward leg of the FX swap can be of a different size 
than the spot transaction when the hedge is rolled. Continuing the previous example, 
if the trader wanted to increase the size of the long-GBP position by GBP500,000 as 
the outstanding forward contract expires, the transactions required would be to (1) 
sell GBP1,000,000 against the CHF spot, to settle the maturing forward contract; and 
(2) buy GBP1,500,000 against the CHF forward. This would be a mismatched swap.
The pricing of swaps will differ slightly depending on whether they are matched 
or mismatched swaps. If the amount of the base currency involved for the spot and 
forward legs of the swap are equal (a matched swap), then these are exactly offsetting 
transactions; one is a buy, the other a sell, and both are for the same amount. Because 
of this equality, a common spot exchange rate is typically applied to both legs of the 
swap transaction; it is standard practice to use the mid-market spot exchange rate for 
a matched swap transaction. However, the forward  points will still be based on either 
the bid or offer, depending on whether the market participant is buying or selling the 
base currency forward. In the earlier example, the trader is buying  the GBP (the base 
currency) forward and would hence pay the offer  side of the market for forward points.
If the FX swap is mismatched, then pricing will need to reflect the difference in 
trade sizes between the two legs of the transaction. Continuing the example in which 
the trader increased the size of the long-GBP position by GBP500,000, this mismatched 
swap is equivalent to (1) a matched swap for a size of GBP1,000,000, and (2) an outright 
forward contract buying GBP500,000. Pricing for the mismatched swap must reflect 
this net GBP purchase amount. Because the matched swap would already price the 
forward points on the offer side of the market, typically this mismatched size adjust -
ment would be reflected in the spot rate quoted as the base for the FX swap. Because 
a net amount of GBP is being bought , the spot quote would now be on the offer  side 
of the CHF/GBP spot rate quote. (In addition, the trader would still pay the offer side 
of the market for the forward points.)
We will return to these topics later in the reading when discussing in more depth 
the use of forward contracts and FX swaps to adjust hedge ratios. (A hedge ratio  is 
the ratio of the nominal value of the derivatives contract used as a hedge to the market 
value of the hedged asset.)
Currency Options
The final product type within FX markets is currency options. The market for currency 
options is, in many ways, similar to option markets for other asset classes, such as 
bonds and equities. As in other markets, the most common options in FX markets 
are call and put options, which are widely used for both risk management and specu -
lative purposes. However, in addition to these vanilla options, the FX market is also 
characterized by active trading in exotic options. (“Exotic” options have a variety of 
features that make them exceptionally flexible risk management tools, compared with 
vanilla options.)
The risk management uses of both vanilla and exotic currency options will be 
examined in subsequent sections. Although daily turnover in FX options market is 
small in relative  terms compared with the overall daily flow in global spot currency 
markets, because the overall currency market is so large, the absolute  size of the FX 
options market is still very considerable.
Currency Risk and Portfolio Risk and Return 149
CURRENCY RISK AND PORTFOLIO RISK AND RETURN
analyze the effects of currency movements on portfolio risk and 
return
In this section, we examine the effect of currency movements on asset returns and 
portfolio risk. We then turn to how these effects help determine construction of a 
foreign asset portfolio.
Return Decomposition
In this section, we examine how international exposure affects a portfolio’s return. 
A domestic asset  is an asset that trades in the investor’s domestic currency  (or 
home currency ). From a portfolio manager’s perspective, the domestic currency is 
the one in which portfolio valuation and returns are reported. Domestic  refers to a 
relation between the currency denomination of the asset and the investor; it is not 
an inherent property of either the asset or the currency. An example of a domestic 
asset is a USD-denominated bond portfolio from the perspective of a US-domiciled 
investor. The return on a domestic asset is not affected by exchange rate movements 
of the domestic currency.
Foreign assets  are assets denominated in currencies other than the investor’s home 
currency. An example of a foreign asset is a USD-denominated bond portfolio from 
the perspective of a eurozone-domiciled investor (and for whom the euro is the home 
currency). The return on a foreign asset will be affected by exchange rate movements 
in the home currency against the foreign currency . Continuing with our example, 
the return to the eurozone-domiciled investor will be affected by the USD return on 
the USD-denominated bond as well as movements in the exchange rate between the 
home currency and the foreign currency, the EUR and USD respectively.
The return of the foreign asset measured in foreign-currency terms is known as the 
foreign-currency return . Extending the example, if the value of the USD-denominated 
bond increased by 10%, measured in USD, that increase is the foreign-currency return 
to the eurozone-domiciled investor. The domestic-currency return  on a foreign 
asset will reflect both the foreign-currency return on that asset as well as percentage 
movements in the spot exchange rate between the home and foreign currencies. The 
domestic-currency return is multiplicative with respect to these two factors:
 RDC = (1 + RFC)(1 + RFX) − 1   (1)
where RDC is the domestic-currency return (in percent), RFC is the foreign-currency 
return, and  RFX is the percentage change of the foreign currency against the domestic 
currency.
Returning to the example, the domestic-currency return for the eurozone-domiciled 
investor on the USD-denominated bond will reflect both the bond’s USD-denominated 
return as well as movements in the exchange rate between the USD and the EUR. 
Suppose that the foreign-currency return on the USD-denominated bond is 10% and 
the USD appreciates by 5% against the EUR. In this case, the domestic-currency return 
to the eurozone investor will be:
 (1 + 10%)(1 + 5%) − 1 = (1.10)(1.05) − 1 = 0.155 = 15.5%
Although the concept is seemingly straightforward, the reader should be aware that 
Equation 1  hides a subtlety that must be recognized. The term RFX is defined as the 
percentage change in the foreign currency against the domestic currency. However, 
this change is not always the same thing as the percentage change in the spot rate 3

using market standard P/B quotes (for example, as shown in Exhibit 2 ). Specifically, it 
is not always the case that RFX = %∆SP/B, where the term on the right side of the equal 
sign is defined in standard FX market convention (note that %Δ is percentage change).
In other words, RFX is calculated as the change in the directly quoted exchange 
rate, where the domestic currency is defined as the investor’s home currency. Because 
market quotes are not always in direct terms, analysts will need to convert to direct 
quotes before calculating percentage changes.
With this nuance in mind, what holds for the domestic-currency return of a sin -
gle foreign asset also holds for the returns on a multi-currency portfolio of foreign 
assets, except now the portfolio weights must be considered. More generally, the 
domestic-currency return on a portfolio of multiple foreign assets will be equal to
   R  DC   =  ∑ 
i=1  n
   ω  i     (  1 +  R  FC,i   )       (  1 +  R  FX,i   )     − 1   (2)
where RFC,i is the foreign-currency return on the i-th foreign asset, RFX,i is the 
appreciation of the i-th foreign currency against the domestic currency, and ωi are 
the portfolio weights of the foreign-currency assets (defined as the percentage of the 
aggregate domestic-currency value of the portfolio) and   ∑ 
i=1  n
   ω  i     = 1. (Note that if short 
selling is allowed in the portfolio, some of the ωi can be less than zero.) Again, it is 
important that the exchange rate notation in this expression (used to calculate RFX,i) 
must be consistently defined with the domestic currency as the price currency.
Assume the following information for a portfolio held by an investor in India. 
Performance is measured in terms of the Indian rupee (INR) and the weights of the two 
assets in the portfolio, at the beginning of the period, are 80% for the GBP-denominated 
asset and 20% for the EUR-denominated asset, respectively. (Note that the portfolio 
weights are measured in terms of a common currency, the INR, which is the investor’s 
domestic currency in this case.)

The domestic-currency return ( RDC) is calculated as follows:
 RDC = 0.80(1 + RFC,GBP )(1 + RFX,GBP ) + 0.20(1 + RFC,EUR )(1 + RFX,EUR ) −1  
Note that given the exchange rate quoting convention, the INR is the price currency 
in the P/B quote for both currency pairs. Adding the data from the table leads to:
   R  DC   = 0.80   (    50.70 _ 43.80   )       (    101.60 _ 95.80   )     + 0.20   (    12.17 _ 14.08   )       (    86.45 _ 86.95   )     − 1 
This solves to 0.154 or 15.4%.
To get the expected  future return on a foreign-currency asset portfolio, based 
on Equation 2 , the portfolio manager would need a market opinion for the expected 
price movement in each of the foreign assets ( RA,i) and exchange rates ( RFX,i) in the 
portfolio. There are typically correlations between all of these variables—correlations 
Currency Risk and Portfolio Risk and Return 151
between the foreign asset price movements across countries, correlations between 
movements among various currency pairs, and correlations between exchange rate 
movements and foreign-currency asset returns. The portfolio manager would need 
to account for these correlations when forming expectations about future asset price 
and exchange rate movements.
Volatility Decomposition
Now we will turn to examining the effect of currency movements on the volatility of 
domestic-currency returns. Equation 1  can be rearranged as
 RDC = (1 + RFC)(1 + RFX) − 1 = RFC + RFX + RFCRFX
When RFC and RFX are small, then the cross-term ( RFCRFX) is small, and as a result 
this equation can be approximated as
 RDC ≈ RFC + RFX          (3)
We return to the example in which the foreign-currency return on the USD-denominated 
bond was 10% and the USD appreciated by 5% against the EUR. In this example, the 
domestic-currency return for the Eurozone investor’s holding in the USD-denominated 
bond was approximately equal to 10% + 5% = 15% (which is close to the exact value of 
15.5%). We can combine the approximation of Equation 3  with the statistical rule that:
   σ   2    (   ω  x   X +  ω  y   Y )     =  ω  x  2   σ   2    (  X )     +  ω  y  2   σ   2    (  Y )     + 2  ω  x    ω  y   σ   (  X )    σ   (  Y )    ρ   (  X, Y )      (4)
where X and Y are random variables, ω are weights attached to X and Y, σ2 is variance of 
a random variable, σ is the corresponding standard deviation, and ρ represents the cor -
relation between two random variables. Applying this result to the domestic-currency 
return approximation of Equation 3  leads to:
 σ2(RDC) ≈ σ2(RFC) + σ2(RFX) + 2σ( RFC)σ(RFX)ρ(RFC,RFX)   (5)
This equation is for the variance of the domestic-currency returns ( RDC), but risk is 
more typically defined in terms of standard deviation because mean and standard 
deviation are measured in the same units (percent, in this case). Hence, the total 
risk for domestic-currency returns—that is, σ( RDC)—is the square root of the results 
calculated in Equation 5 .
Note as well that because Equation 5  is based on the addition of all three terms 
on the right side of the equal sign, exchange rate exposure will generally cause the 
variance of domestic-currency returns, σ2(RDC), to increase to more than that of the 
foreign-currency returns, σ2(RFC), considered on their own. That is, if there was no 
exchange rate risk, then it would be the case that σ2(RDC) = σ2(RFC). Using this as 
our base-case scenario, adding exchange rate risk exposure to the portfolio usually 
adds to domestic-currency return variance (the effect is indeterminate if exchange 
rate movements are negatively correlated with foreign asset returns).
These results on the variance of domestic-currency return can be generalized 
to a portfolio of foreign-currency assets. If we define the random variables X and 
Y in Equation 4  in terms of the domestic-currency return ( RDC) of two different 
foreign-currency investments, and the ωi as portfolio weights that sum to one, then 
the result is the variance of the domestic-currency returns for the overall foreign 
asset portfolio:
    σ   2    (   ω  1    R  1   +  ω  2    R  2   )    
   
≈  ω  1  2   σ   2    (   R  1   )     +  ω  2  2   σ   2    (   R  2   )     + 2  ω  1    ω  2   σ   (   R  1   )    σ   (   R  2   )    ρ   (   R  1  ,  R  2   )       (6)
where Ri is the domestic-currency return of the i-th foreign-currency asset. But 
as shown in Equation 3 , the domestic-currency return of a foreign-currency asset 
(RDC) is itself based on the sum of two random variables: RFC and RFX. This means 
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 152
that we would have to embed the variance expression shown in Equation 5  in each  of 
the σ2(Ri) shown in Equation 6  to get the complete solution for the domestic-currency 
return variance of the overall portfolio. (We would also have to calculate the correla -
tions between all of the Ri.) These requirements would lead to a very cumbersome 
mathematical expression for even a portfolio of only two foreign-currency assets; 
the expression would be far more complicated for a portfolio with many foreign 
currencies involved.
Thus, rather than attempt to give the complete mathematical formula for the 
variance of domestic-currency returns for a multi-currency portfolio, we will instead 
focus on the key intuition behind this expression. Namely, that the domestic-currency 
risk exposure of the overall portfolio—that is, σ( RDC)—will depend not only on the 
variances of each  of the foreign-currency returns ( RFC) and exchange rate movements 
(RFX) but also on how each of these interacts  with the others. Generally speaking, 
negative correlations among these variables will help reduce the overall portfolio’s 
risk through diversification effects.
Note as well that the overall portfolio’s risk exposure will depend on the portfolio 
weights (ωi) used. If short-selling is allowed in the portfolio, some of these ωi can be 
negative as long as the total portfolio weights sum to one. So, for two foreign assets 
with a strong positive return correlation, short selling one can create considerable 
diversification benefits for the portfolio. (This approach is equivalent to trading move -
ments in the price spread between these two assets.)
As before with the difference between realized and expected domestic-currency 
portfolio returns ( RDC), there is a difference between realized and expected 
domestic-currency portfolio risk, σ( RDC). For Equation 6  to apply to the expected 
future volatility of the domestic-currency return of a multi-currency foreign asset 
portfolio, we would need to replace the observed, historical values of the variances and 
covariances in Equation 6  with their expected future values. This can be challenging, 
not only because it potentially involves a large number of variables but also because 
historical price patterns are not always a good guide to future price behavior. Variance 
and correlation measures are sensitive to the time period used to estimate them and 
can also vary over time. These variance and correlation measures can either drift 
randomly with time, or they can be subject to abrupt movements in times of market 
stress. It should also be clear that these observed, historical volatility and correlation 
measures need not be the same as the forward-looking implied  volatility (and correla -
tion) derived from option prices. Although sometimes various survey or consensus 
forecasts can be used, these too can be sensitive to sample size and composition and 
are not always available on a timely basis or with a consistent starting point. As with 
any forecast, they are also not necessarily an accurate guide to future developments; 
judgment must be used.
Hence, to calculate the expected future risk of the foreign asset portfolio, the 
portfolio manager would need a market opinion—however derived—on the variance 
of each of the foreign-currency asset returns ( RFC) over the investment horizon as 
well the variance of future exchange rate movements ( RFX) for each currency pair. 
The portfolio manager would also need a market opinion of how each of these future 
variables would interact with each other (i.e., their expected correlations). Historical 
price patterns can serve as a guide, and with computers and large databases, this 
modeling problem is daunting but not intractable. But the portfolio manager must 
always be mindful that historical risk patterns may not repeat going forward.
Currency Risk and Portfolio Risk and Return 153
EXAMPLE 1
Portfolio Risk and Return Calculations
The following table shows current and future expected asset prices, measured 
in their domestic currencies, for both eurozone and Canadian assets (these can 
be considered “total return” indexes). The table also has the corresponding data 
for the CAD/EUR spot rate.
 
  Eurozone   Canada
Today Expected   Today Expected
Asset price 100.69 101.50   101.00 99.80
CAD/EUR 1.4500 1.4700     
 
1. What is the expected domestic-currency return for a eurozone investor 
holding the Canadian asset?
Solution to 1:
For the eurozone investor, the RFC = (99.80/101.00) − 1 = −1.19%. Note that, 
given we are considering the eurozone to be “domestic” for this investor 
and given the way the RFX expression is defined, we will need to convert the 
CAD/EUR exchange rate quote so that the EUR is the price  currency. This 
leads to RFX = [(1/1.4700)/(1/1.4500)] − 1 = −1.364%. Hence, for the euro -
zone investor, RDC = (1 − 1.19%)(1 ‒ 1.364%) − 1 = −2.53%.
2. What is the expected domestic-currency return for a Canadian investor 
holding the eurozone asset?
Solution to 2:
For the Canadian investor, the RFC = (101.50/100.69) − 1 = +0.80%. Given 
that in the CAD/EUR quote the CAD is the price currency, for this investor 
the RFX = (1.4700/1.4500) − 1 = +1.38%. Hence, for the Canadian investor 
the RDC = (1 + 0.80%)(1 + 1.38%) − 1 = 2.19%.
3. From the perspective of the Canadian investor, assume that σ( RFC) = 3% (the 
expected risk for the foreign-currency asset is 3%) and the σ( RFX) = 2% (the 
expected risk of exchange rate movements is 2%). Furthermore, the expect -
ed correlation between movements in foreign-currency asset returns and 
movements in the CAD/EUR rate is +0.5. What is the expected risk of the 
domestic-currency return [σ( RDC)]?
Solution to 3:
Because this is a single foreign-currency asset we are considering (not a 
portfolio of such assets), we can use Equation 5 :
 σ2(RDC) ≈ σ2(RFC) + σ2(RFX) + 2σ( RFC)σ(RFX)ρ(RFC,RFX) 
Inserting the relevant data leads to
 σ2(RDC) ≈ (3%)2 + (2%)2 + 2(3%)(2%)(0.50) = 0.0019
Taking the square root of this leads to σ( RDC) ≈ 4.36%. (Note that the units 
in these expressions are all in percent, so in this case 3% is equivalent to 0.03 
for calculation purposes.)

STRATEGIC DECISIONS IN CURRENCY MANAGEMENT
discuss strategic choices in currency management
There are a variety of approaches to currency management, ranging from trying to 
avoid all currency risk in a portfolio to actively seeking foreign exchange risk in order 
to manage it and enhance portfolio returns.
There is no firm consensus—either among academics or practitioners—about the 
most effective way to manage currency risk. Some investment managers try to hedge 
all currency risk, some leave their portfolios unhedged, and others see currency risk 
as a potential source of incremental return to the portfolio and will actively trade 
foreign exchange. These widely varying management practices reflect a variety of 
factors including investment objectives, investment constraints, and beliefs about 
currency markets.
Concerning beliefs, one camp of thought holds that in the long run currency effects 
cancel out to zero as exchange rates revert to historical means or their fundamental 
values. Moreover, an efficient currency market is a zero-sum game (currency “ A” 
cannot appreciate against currency “B” without currency “B” depreciating against 
currency “ A”), so there should not be any long-run gains overall to speculating in 
currencies, especially after netting out management and transaction costs. Therefore, 
both currency hedging and actively trading currencies represent a cost to a portfolio 
with little prospect of consistently positive active returns.
At the other extreme, another camp of thought notes that currency movements 
can have a dramatic impact on short-run returns and return volatility and holds that 
there are pricing inefficiencies in currency markets. They note that much of the flow in 
currency markets is related to international trade or capital flows in which FX trading 
is being done on a need-to-do basis and these currency trades are just a spinoff of the 
other transactions. Moreover, some market participants are either not in the market on 
a purely profit-oriented basis (e.g., central banks, government agencies) or are believed 
to be “uninformed traders” (primarily retail accounts). Conversely, speculative capital 
seeking to arbitrage inefficiencies is finite. In short, marketplace diversity is believed 
to present the potential for “harvesting alpha” through active currency trading.
This ongoing debate does not make foreign-currency risk in portfolios go away; 
it still needs to managed, or at least, recognized. Ultimately, each portfolio manager 
or investment oversight committee will have to reach their own decisions about how 
to manage risk and whether to seek return enhancement through actively trading 
currency exposures.
Fortunately, there are a well-developed set of financial products and portfolio 
management techniques that help investors manage currency risk no matter what 
their individual objectives, views, and constraints. Indeed, the potential combinations 
of trading tools and strategies are almost infinite, and can shape currency exposures 
to custom-fit individual circumstance and market opinion. In this section, we explore 
various points on a spectrum reflecting currency exposure choices (a risk spectrum) 
and the guidance that portfolio managers use in making strategic decisions about 
where to locate their portfolios on this continuum. First, however, the implication of 
investment objectives and constraints as set forth in the investment policy statement 
must be recognized.4
Strategic Decisions in Currency Management 155
The Investment Policy Statement
The Investment Policy Statement (IPS) mandates the degree of discretionary currency 
management that will be allowed in the portfolio, how it will be benchmarked, and the 
limits on the type of trading polices and tools (e.g., such as leverage) than can be used.
The starting point for organizing the investment plan for any portfolio is the IPS, 
which is a statement that outlines the broad objectives and constraints of the beneficial 
owners of the assets. Most IPS specify many of the following points:
 ■the general objectives of the investment portfolio;
 ■the risk tolerance of the portfolio and its capacity for bearing risk;
 ■the time horizon over which the portfolio is to be invested;
 ■the ongoing income/liquidity needs (if any) of the portfolio; and
 ■the benchmark against which the portfolio will measure overall investment 
returns.
The IPS sets the guiding parameters within which more specific portfolio man -
agement policies are set, including the target asset mix; whether and to what extent 
leverage, short positions, and derivatives can be used; and how actively the portfolio 
will be allowed to trade its various risk exposures.
For most portfolios, currency management can be considered a sub-set of these 
more specific portfolio management policies within the IPS. The currency risk man -
agement policy will usually address such issues as the
 ■target proportion of currency exposure to be passively hedged;
 ■latitude for active currency management around this target;
 ■frequency of hedge rebalancing;
 ■currency hedge performance benchmark to be used; and
 ■hedging tools permitted (types of forward and option contracts, etc.).
Currency management should be conducted within these IPS-mandated parameters.
The Portfolio Optimization Problem
Having described the IPS as the guiding framework for currency management, we now 
examine the strategic choices that have to be made in deciding the benchmark currency 
exposures for the portfolio, and the degree of discretion that will be allowed around 
this benchmark. This process starts with a decision on the optimal foreign-currency 
asset and FX exposures.
Optimization of a multi-currency portfolio of foreign assets involves selecting 
portfolio weights that locate the portfolio on the efficient frontier of the trade-off 
between risk and expected return defined in terms of the investor’s domestic cur -
rency. As a simplification of this process, consider the portfolio manager examining 
the expected return and risk of the multi-currency portfolio of foreign assets by using 
different combinations of portfolio weights (ωi) that were shown in Equations 2 and 
6, respectively, which are repeated here:
   R  DC   =  ∑ 
i=1  n
   ω  i     (  1 +  R  FC,i   )       (  1 +  R  FX,i   )     − 1  
   σ   2    (   ω  1    R  1   +  ω  2    R  2   )     ≈  ω  1  2   σ   2    (   R  1   )     +  ω  2  2   σ   2    (   R  2   )     + 2  ω  1   σ   (   R  1   )     ω  2   σ   (   R  2   )    ρ   (   R  1  ,  R  2   )     
Recall that the Ri in the equation for variance are the RDC for each of the 
foreign-currency assets. Likewise, recall that the RFX term is defined such that the 
investor’s “domestic” currency is the price currency in the P/B exchange rate quote. In 
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 156
other words, this calculation may require using the algebraic reciprocal of the standard 
market quote convention. These two equations together show the domestic-currency 
return and risk for a multi-currency portfolio of foreign assets.
When deciding on an optimal investment position, these equations would be based 
on the expected  returns and risks for each of the foreign-currency assets; and hence, 
including the expected  returns and risks for each of the foreign-currency exposures. 
As we have seen earlier, the number of market parameters for which the portfolio 
manager would need to have a market opinion grows geometrically with the com -
plexity (number of foreign-currency exposures) in the portfolio. That is, to calculate 
the expected efficient frontier, the portfolio manager must have a market opinion 
for each  of the RFC,i, RFX,i,, σ(RFC,i), σ(RFX,i), and ρ( RFC,i RFX,i), as well as for each of 
the ρ( RFC,i RFC,j) and ρ( RFX,i RFX,j). This would be a daunting task for even the most 
well-informed portfolio manager.
In a perfect world with complete (and costless) information, it would likely be 
optimal to jointly  optimize all of the portfolio’s exposures—over all currencies and 
all foreign-currency assets—simultaneously. In the real world, however, this can be 
a much more difficult task. Confronted with these difficulties, many portfolio man -
agers handle asset allocation with currency risk as a two-step process: (1) portfolio 
optimization over fully hedged returns; and (2) selection of active currency exposure, 
if any. Derivative strategies can allow the various risk exposures in a portfolio to be 
“unbundled” from each other and managed separately. The same applies for currency 
risks. Because the use of derivatives allows the price risk ( RFC,i) and exchange rate risk 
(RFX,j) of foreign-currency assets to be unbundled and managed separately, a starting 
point for the selection process of portfolio weights would be to assume a complete 
currency hedge. That is, the portfolio manager will choose the exposures to the 
foreign-currency assets first, and then decide on the appropriate currency exposures 
afterward (i.e., decide whether to relax the full currency hedge). These decisions are 
made to simplify the portfolio construction process.
If the currency exposures of foreign assets could be perfectly and costlessly 
hedged, the hedge would completely neutralize the effect of currency movements on 
the portfolio’s domestic-currency return ( RDC).7 In Equation 2 , this would set RFX = 
0, meaning that the domestic-currency return is then equal to the foreign-currency 
return ( RDC = RFC). In Equation 5 , this would set σ2(RDC) = σ2(RFC), meaning that the 
domestic-currency return risk is equal to the foreign-currency return risk.
Removing the currency effects leads to a simpler, two-step process for portfolio 
optimization. First the portfolio manager could pick the set of portfolio weights (ωi) 
for the foreign-currency assets that optimize the expected foreign-currency asset 
risk–return trade-off (assuming there is no currency risk). Then the portfolio manager 
could choose the desired currency exposures for the portfolio and decide whether 
and by how far to relax the constraint to a full currency hedge for each currency pair.
Choice of Currency Exposures
A natural starting point for the strategic decisions is the “currency-neutral” portfolio 
resulting from the two-step process described earlier. The question then becomes, 
How far along the risk spectrum between being fully hedged and actively trading 
currencies should the portfolio be positioned?
7 A “costless” hedge in this sense would not only mean zero transaction costs, but also no “roll yield. ”
Strategic Decisions in Currency Management 157
Diversification Considerations
The time horizon of the IPS is important. Many investment practitioners believe that 
in the long run, adding unhedged foreign-currency exposure to a portfolio does not 
affect expected long-run portfolio returns; hence in the long run, it would not matter 
if the portfolio was hedged. (Indeed, portfolio management costs would be reduced 
without a hedging process.) This belief is based on the view that in the long run, 
currencies “mean revert” to either some fair value equilibrium level or a historical 
average; that is, that the expected  %ΔS = 0 for a sufficiently long time period. This 
view typically draws on the expectation that purchasing power parity (PPP) and the 
other international parity conditions that link movements in exchange rates, interest 
rates, and inflation rates will eventually hold over the long run.
Supporting this view, some studies argue that in the long-run currencies will in 
fact mean revert, and hence that currency risk is lower in the long run than in the 
short run (an early example is Froot 1993 ). Although much depends on how long run 
is defined, an investor (IPS) with a very long investment horizon and few immediate 
liquidity needs—which could potentially require the liquidation of foreign-currency 
assets at disadvantageous exchange rates—might choose to forgo currency hedging 
and its associated costs. Logically, this would require a portfolio benchmark index 
that is also unhedged against currency risk.
Although the international parity conditions may hold in the long run, it can be 
a very long time—possibly decades. Indeed, currencies can continue to drift away 
from the fair value mean reversion level for much longer than the time period used 
to judge portfolio performance. Such time periods are also typically longer than the 
patience of the portfolio manager’s oversight committee when portfolio performance 
is lagging the benchmark. If this very long-run view perspective is not the case, then 
the IPS will likely impose some form of currency hedging.
Diversification considerations will also depend on the asset composition  of the 
foreign-currency asset portfolio. The reason is because the foreign-currency asset 
returns ( RFC) of different asset classes have different correlation patterns with 
foreign-currency returns ( RFX). If there is a negative correlation between these two 
sets of returns, having at least some currency exposure may help portfolio diversifi -
cation and moderate the domestic-currency return risk, σ( RDC). (Refer to Equation 
5 in Section 3.)
It is often asserted that the correlation between foreign-currency returns and 
foreign-currency asset returns tends to be greater for fixed-income portfolios than 
for equity portfolios. This assertion makes intuitive sense: both bonds and curren -
cies react strongly to movements in interest rates, whereas equities respond more to 
expected earnings. As a result, the implication is that currency exposures provide little 
diversification benefit to fixed-income portfolios and that the currency risk should be 
hedged. In contrast, a better argument can be made for carrying currency exposures 
in global equity portfolios.
To some degree, various studies have corroborated this relative advantage to 
currency hedging for fixed income portfolios. But the evidence seems somewhat 
mixed and depends on which markets are involved. One study found that the hedging 
advantage for fixed-income portfolios is not always large or consistent ( Darnell 2004 ). 
Other studies ( Campbell 2010 ; Martini 2010 ) found that the optimal hedge ratio for 
foreign-currency equity portfolios depended critically on the investor’s domestic 
currency. (Recall that the hedge ratio is defined as the ratio of the nominal value of 
the hedge to the market value of the underlying.) For some currencies, there was no 
risk-reduction advantage to hedging foreign equities (the optimal hedge ratio was 
close to 0%), whereas for other currencies, the optimal hedge ratio for foreign equities 
was close to 100%.
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 158
Other studies indicate that the optimal hedge ratio also seems to depend on market 
conditions  and longer-term trends in currency pairs. For example, Campbell, Serfaty-de 
Medeiros, and Viceira (2007)  found that there were no diversification benefits from 
currency exposures in foreign-currency bond portfolios, and hence to minimize 
the risk to domestic-currency returns these positions should be fully hedged. The 
authors also found, however, that during the time of their study (their data spanned 
1975 to 2005), the US dollar seemed to be an exception in terms of its correlations 
with foreign-currency asset returns. Their study found that the US dollar tended to 
appreciate against foreign currencies when global bond prices fell (for example, in 
times of global financial stress there is a tendency for investors to shift investments 
into the perceived safety of reserve currencies). This finding would suggest that keep -
ing some exposure to the US dollar in a global bond portfolio would be beneficial. 
For non-US investors, this would mean under-hedging the currency exposure to the 
USD (i.e., a hedge ratio less than 100%), whereas for US investors it would mean 
over-hedging their foreign-currency exposures back into the USD. Note that some 
currencies—the USD, JPY, and CHF in particular—seem to act as a safe haven and 
appreciate in times of market stress. Keeping some of these currency exposures in 
the portfolio—having hedge ratios that are not set at 100%--can help hedge losses on 
riskier assets, especially for foreign currency equity portfolios (which are more risk 
exposed than bond portfolios).
Given this diversity of opinions and empirical findings, it is not surprising to see 
actual hedge ratios vary widely in practice among different investors. Nonetheless, it is 
still more likely to see currency hedging for fixed-income portfolios rather than equity 
portfolios, although actual hedge ratios will often vary between individual managers.
Cost Considerations
The costs of currency hedging also guide the strategic positioning of the portfolio. 
Currency hedges are not a “free good” and they come with a variety of expenses that 
must be borne by the overall portfolio. Optimal hedging decisions will need to balance 
the benefits of hedging against these costs.
Hedging costs come mainly in two forms: trading costs and opportunity costs. 
The most immediate costs of hedging involve trading expenses, and these come in 
several forms:
 ■Trading involves dealing on the bid–offer spread offered by banks. Their 
profit margin is based on these spreads, and the more the client trades 
and “pays away the spread, ” the more profit is generated by the dealer. 
Maintaining a 100% hedge and rebalancing frequently with every minor 
change in market conditions would be expensive. Although the bid–offer 
spreads on many FX-related products (especially the spot exchange rate) 
are quite narrow, “churning” the hedge portfolio would progressively add to 
hedging costs and detract from the hedge’s benefits.
 ■Some hedges involve currency options; a long position in currency options 
requires the payment of up-front premiums. If the options expire out of the 
money (OTM), this cost is unrecoverable.
 ■Although forward contracts do not require the payment of up-front premi -
ums, they do eventually mature and have to be “rolled” forward with an FX 
swap transaction to maintain the hedge. Rolling hedges will typically gen -
erate cash inflows or outflows. These cash flows will have to be monitored, 
and as necessary, cash will have to be raised to settle hedging transactions. 
In other words, even though the currency hedge may reduce  the volatility of 
the domestic mark-to-market value of the foreign-currency asset portfolio, 
it will typically increase  the volatility in the organization’s cash accounts. 
Strategic Decisions in Currency Management 159
Managing these cash flow costs can accumulate to become a significant 
portion of the portfolio’s value, and they become more expensive (for cash 
outflows) the higher interest rates go.
 ■One of the most important trading costs is the need to maintain an adminis -
trative infrastructure for trading. Front-, middle-, and back-office operations 
will have to be set up, staffed with trained personnel, and provided with 
specialized technology systems. Settlement of foreign exchange transactions 
in a variety of currencies means having to maintain cash accounts in these 
currencies to make and receive these foreign-currency payments. Together 
all of these various overhead costs can form a significant portion of the 
overall costs of currency trading.
A second form of costs associated with hedging are the opportunity cost of the 
hedge. To be 100% hedged is to forgo any possibility of favorable currency rate moves. 
If skillfully handled, accepting and managing currency risk—or any financial risk—can 
potentially add value to the portfolio, even net of management fees. (We discuss the 
methods by which this might be done in Sections 7–8.)
These opportunity costs lead to another motivation for having a strategic hedge ratio 
of less than 100%: regret minimization. Although it is not possible to accurately predict 
foreign exchange movements in advance, it is certainly possible to judge after the fact 
the results of the decision to hedge or not. Missing out on an advantageous currency 
movement because of a currency hedge can cause ex post  regret in the portfolio man -
ager or client; so too can having a foreign-currency loss if the foreign-currency asset 
position was unhedged. Confronted with this ex ante  dilemma of whether to hedge, 
many portfolio managers decide simply to “split the difference” and have a 50% hedge 
ratio (or some other rule-of-thumb number). Both survey evidence and anecdotal 
evidence show that there is a wide variety of hedge ratios actually used in practice 
by managers, and that these variations cannot be explained by more “fundamental” 
factors alone. Instead, many managers appear to incorporate some degree of regret 
minimization into hedging decisions (for example, see Michenaud and Solnik 2008 ).
All of these various hedging expenses—both trading and opportunity costs—will 
need to be managed. Hedging is a form of insurance against risk, and in purchasing 
any form of insurance the buyer matches their needs and budgets with the policy 
selected. For example, although it may be possible to buy an insurance policy with 
full, unlimited coverage, a zero deductible, and no co-pay arrangements, such a policy 
would likely be prohibitively expensive. Most insurance buyers decide that it is not 
necessary to insure against every outcome, no matter how minor. Some minor risks 
can be accepted and “self-insured” through the deductible; some major risks may be 
considered so unlikely that they are not seen as worth paying the extra premium. (For 
example, most ordinary people would likely not consider buying insurance against 
being kidnapped.)
These same principles apply to currency hedging. The portfolio manager (and IPS) 
would likely not try to hedge every minor, daily change in exchange rates or asset 
values, but only the larger adverse movements that can materially affect the overall 
domestic-currency returns ( RDC) of the foreign-currency asset portfolio. The portfolio 
manager will need to balance the benefits and costs of hedging in determining both 
strategic positioning of the portfolio as well as any latitude for active currency man -
agement. However, around whatever strategic positioning decision taken by the IPS 
in terms of the benchmark level of currency exposure, hedging cost considerations 
alone will often dictate a range  of permissible exposures instead of a single point. (This 
discretionary range is similar to the deductible in an insurance policy.)
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 160
SPECTRUM OF CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT 
STRATEGIES
discuss strategic choices in currency management
The strategic decisions encoded in the IPS with regard to the trade-off between the 
benefits and costs of hedging, as well as the potential for incremental return to the 
portfolio from active currency management, are the foundation for determining spe -
cific currency management strategies. These strategies are arrayed along a spectrum 
from very risk-averse passive hedging, to actively seeking out currency risk in order 
to manage it for profit. We examine each in turn.
Passive Hedging
In this approach, the goal is to keep the portfolio’s currency exposures close, if not 
equal to, those of a benchmark portfolio used to evaluate performance. Note that 
the benchmark portfolio often has no foreign exchange exposure, particularly for 
fixed-income assets; the benchmark index is a “local currency” index based only on 
the foreign-currency asset return ( RFC). However, benchmark indexes that have some 
foreign exchange risk are also possible.
Passive hedging is a rules-based approach that removes almost all discretion from 
the portfolio manager, regardless of the manager’s market opinion on future move -
ments in exchange rates or other financial prices. In this case, the manager’s job is to 
keep portfolio exposures as close to “neutral” as possible and to minimize tracking 
errors against the benchmark portfolio’s performance. This approach reflects the belief 
that currency exposures that differ from the benchmark portfolio inject risk (return 
volatility) into the portfolio without any sufficiently compensatory return. Active cur -
rency management—taking positional views on future exchange rate movements—is 
viewed as being incapable of consistently adding incremental return to the portfolio.
But the hedge ratio has a tendency to “drift” with changes in market conditions, 
and even passive hedges need periodic rebalancing to realign them with investment 
objectives. Often the management guidance given to the portfolio manager will spec -
ify the rebalancing period—for example, monthly. There may also be allowance for 
intra-period rebalancing if there have been large exchange rate movements.
Discretionary Hedging
This approach is similar to passive hedging in that there is a “neutral” benchmark 
portfolio against which actual portfolio performance will be measured. However, in 
contrast to a strictly rules-based approach, the portfolio manager now has some limited 
discretion on how far to allow actual portfolio risk exposures to vary from the neutral 
position. Usually this discretion is defined in terms of percentage of foreign-currency 
market value (the portfolio’s currency exposures are allowed to vary plus or minus 
x% from the benchmark). For example, a eurozone-domiciled investor may have a US 
Treasury bond portfolio with a mandate to keep the hedge ratio within 95% to 105%. 
Assuming no change in the foreign-currency return ( RFC), but allowing exchange rates 
(RFX) to vary, this means the portfolio can tolerate exchange rate movements between 
the EUR and USD of up to 5% before the exchange rate exposures in the portfolio are 
considered excessive. The manager is allowed to manage currency exposures within 
these limits without being considered in violation of the IPS.5
Spectrum of Currency Risk Management Strategies 161
This discretion allows the portfolio manager at least some limited ability to express 
directional opinions about future currency movements—to accept risk in an attempt 
to earn reward—in order to add value to the portfolio performance. Of course, the 
portfolio manager’s actual performance will be compared with that of the benchmark 
portfolio.
Active Currency Management
Further along the spectrum between extreme risk aversion and purely speculative 
trading is active currency management. In principle, this approach is really just 
an extension of discretionary hedging: the portfolio manager is allowed to express 
directional opinions on exchange rates, but is nonetheless kept within mandated risk 
limits. The performance of the manager—the choices of risk exposures assumed—is 
benchmarked against a “neutral” portfolio. But for all forms of active management (i.e., 
having the discretion to express directional market views), there is no allowance for 
unlimited speculation; there are risk management systems in place for even the most 
speculative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds. These controls are designed 
to prevent traders from taking unusually large currency exposures and risking the 
solvency of the firm or fund.
In many cases, the difference between discretionary hedging and active currency 
management is one of emphasis more than degree. The primary duty of the discre -
tionary hedger is to protect the portfolio from currency risk. As a secondary goal, 
within limited bounds, there is some scope for directional opinion in an attempt to 
enhance overall portfolio returns. If the manager lacks any firm market conviction, the 
natural neutral position for the discretionary hedger is to be flat—that is, to have no 
meaningful currency exposures. In contrast, the active currency manager is supposed 
to take currency risks and manage them for profit. The primary goal is to add alpha 
to the portfolio through successful trading. Leaving actual portfolio exposures near 
zero for extended periods is typically not a viable option.
Currency Overlay
Active management of currency exposures can extend beyond limited managerial 
discretion within hedging boundaries. Sometimes accepting and managing currency 
risk for profit can be considered a portfolio objective. Active currency management 
is often associated with what are called currency overlay programs , although this 
term is used differently by different sources.
 ■In the most limited sense of the term, currency overlay simply means that 
the portfolio manager has outsourced managing currency exposures to a 
firm specializing in FX management. This could imply something as limited 
as merely having the external party implement a fully passive approach to 
currency hedges. If dealing with FX markets and managing currency hedges 
is beyond the professional competence of the investment manager, whose 
focus is on managing foreign equities or some other asset class, then hiring 
such external professional help is an option. Note that typically currency 
overlay programs involve external managers. However, some large, sophisti -
cated institutional investors may have in-house currency overlay programs 
managed by a separate group of specialists within the firm.
 ■A broader view of currency overlay allows the externally hired currency 
overlay manager to take directional views on future currency movements 
(again, with the caveat that these be kept within predefined bounds). 
Sometimes a distinction is made between currency overlay and “foreign 
exchange as an asset class. ” In this classification, currency overlay is limited 
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 162
to the currency exposures already in the foreign asset portfolio. For exam -
ple, if a eurozone-domiciled investor has GBP- and CHF-denominated 
assets, currency overlay risks are allowed only for these currencies.
 ■In contrast, the concept of foreign exchange as an asset class does not 
restrict the currency overlay manager, who is free to take FX exposures in 
any currency pair where there is value-added to be harvested, regardless 
of the underlying portfolio. In this sense, the currency overlay manager is 
very similar to an FX-based hedge fund. To implement this form of active 
currency management, the currency overlay manager would have a joint  
opinion on a range of currencies, and have market views not only on the 
expected movements in the spot rates but also the likelihood of these move -
ments (the variance of the expected future spot rate distribution) as well as 
the expected correlation between future spot rate movements. Basically, the 
entire portfolio of currencies is actively managed and optimized over all of 
the expected returns, risks, and correlations among all of the currencies in 
the portfolio.
We will focus on this latter form of currency overlay in this reading: active currency 
management conducted by external, FX-specialized sub-advisors to the portfolio.
It is quite possible to have the foreign-currency asset portfolio fully hedged (or 
allow some discretionary hedging internally) but then also to add an external cur -
rency overlay manager to the portfolio. This approach separates the hedging and 
alpha function mandates of the portfolio. Different organizations have different areas 
of expertise; it often makes sense to allocate managing the hedge (currency “beta”) 
and managing the active FX exposures (currency “alpha”) to those individuals with a 
comparative advantage in that function.
Adding this form of currency overlay to the portfolio (FX as an asset class) is similar 
in principle to adding any type of alternative asset class, such as private equity funds 
or farmland. In each case, the goal is the search for alpha. But to be most effective in 
adding value to the portfolio, the currency overlay program should add incremental 
returns (alpha) and/or greater diversification opportunities to improve the portfolio’s 
risk–return profile. To do this, the currency alpha mandate should have minimum cor -
relation with both the major asset classes and the other alpha sources in the portfolio.
Once this FX as an asset class approach is taken, it is not necessary to restrict 
the portfolio to a single overlay manager any more than it is necessary to restrict the 
portfolio to a single private equity fund. Different overlay managers follow different 
strategies (these are described in more detail in Sections 7–8). Within the overall 
portfolio allocation to “currency as an alternative asset class” , it may be beneficial to 
diversify across a range of active management styles, either by engaging several cur -
rency overlay managers with different styles or by applying a fund-of-funds approach, 
in which the hiring and management of individual currency overlay managers is 
delegated to a specialized external investment vehicle.
Whether managed internally or externally (via a fund of funds) it will be necessary 
to monitor, or benchmark, the performance of the currency overlay manager: Do they 
generate the returns expected from their stated trading strategy? Many major invest -
ment banks as well as specialized market-information firms provide a wide range of 
proprietary indexes that track the performance of the investible universe of currency 
overlay managers; sometimes they also offer sub-indexes that focus on specific trading 
strategies (for example, currency positioning based on macroeconomic fundamentals). 
However, the methodologies used to calculate these various indexes vary between 
suppliers. In addition, different indexes show different aspects of active currency 
management. Given these differences between indexes, there is no simple answer for 
which index is most suitable as a benchmark; much depends on the specifics of the 
active currency strategy.
Spectrum of Currency Risk Management Strategies 163
EXAMPLE 2
Currency Overlay
Windhoek Capital Management is a South Africa-based investment manager 
that runs the Conservative Value Fund, which has a mandate to avoid all cur -
rency risk in the portfolio. The firm is considering engaging a currency overlay 
manager to help with managing the foreign exchange exposures of this invest -
ment vehicle. Windhoek does not consider itself to have the in-house expertise 
to manage FX risk.
Brixworth & St. Ives Asset Management is a UK-based investment manager, 
and runs the Aggressive Growth Fund. This fund is heavily weighted toward 
emerging market equities, but also has a mandate to seek out inefficiencies in the 
global foreign exchange market and exploit these for profit. Although Brixworth 
& St. Ives manages the currency hedges for all of its investment funds in-house, 
it is also considering engaging a currency overlay manager.
1. Using a currency overlay manager for the Conservative Value Fund is most 
likely  to involve:
A. joining the alpha and hedging mandates.
B. a more active approach to managing currency risks.
C. using this manager to passively hedge their foreign exchange 
exposures.
Solution to 1:
C is correct. The Conservative Value Fund wants to avoid all currency 
exposures in the portfolio and Windhoek believes that it lacks the currency 
management expertise to do this.
2. Using a currency overlay manager for the Aggressive Growth Fund is most 
likely  to involve:
A. separating the alpha and hedging mandates.
B. a less discretionary approach to managing currency hedges.
C. an IPS that limits active management to emerging market currencies.
Solution to 2:
A is correct. Brixworth & St. Ives already does the FX hedging in house, so a 
currency overlay is more likely to be a pure alpha mandate. This should not 
change the way that Brixworth & St. Ives manages its hedges, and the fund’s 
mandate to seek out inefficiencies in the global FX market is unlikely to lead 
to a restriction to actively manage only emerging market currencies.
3. Brixworth & St. Ives is more likely  to engage multiple currency overlay man -
agers if:
A. their returns are correlated with asset returns in the fund.
B. the currency managers’ returns are correlated with each other.
C. the currency managers’ use different active management strategies.
Solution to 3:
C is correct. Different active management strategies may lead to a more 
diversified source of alpha generation, and hence reduced portfolio risk. 
Choices A and B are incorrect because a higher correlation with for -
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 164
eign-currency assets in the portfolio or among overlay manager returns is 
likely to lead to less diversification.
FORMULATING A CURRENCY MANAGEMENT 
PROGRAM
formulate an appropriate currency management program given 
financial market conditions and portfolio objectives and constraints
We now try to bring all of these previous considerations together in describing how 
to formulate an appropriate currency management program given client objectives 
and constraints, as well as overall financial market conditions. Generally speaking, 
the strategic  currency positioning of the portfolio, as encoded in the IPS, should be 
biased toward a more-fully hedged currency management program the more
 ■short term the investment objectives of the portfolio;
 ■risk averse the beneficial owners of the portfolio are (and impervious to ex 
post regret over missed opportunities);
 ■immediate the income and/or liquidity needs of the portfolio;
 ■fixed-income assets are held in a foreign-currency portfolio;
 ■cheaply a hedging program can be implemented;
 ■volatile (i.e., risky) financial markets are;8 and
 ■skeptical the beneficial owners and/or management oversight committee are 
of the expected benefits of active currency management.
The relaxation of any of these conditions creates latitude to allow a more proac -
tive currency risk posture in the portfolio, either through wider tolerance bands for 
discretionary hedging, or by introducing foreign currencies as a separate asset class 
(using currency overlay programs as an alternative asset class in the overall portfo -
lio). In the latter case, the more currency overlay is expected to generate alpha that 
is uncorrelated with other asset or alpha-generation programs in the portfolio, the 
more it is likely to be allowed in terms of strategic portfolio positioning.
INVESTMENT POLICY STATEMENT
Kailua Kona Advisors runs a Hawaii-based hedge fund that focuses on developed 
market equities located outside of North America. Its investor base consists of 
local high-net-worth individuals who are all considered to have a long invest -
ment horizon, a high tolerance for risk, and no immediate income needs. In its 
prospectus to investors, Kailua Kona indicates that it actively manages both the 
fund’s equity and foreign-currency exposures, and that the fund uses leverage 
through the use of loans as well as short-selling.
Exhibit 4  presents the hedge fund’s currency management policy included 
in the IPS for this hedge fund.
8 As we will see, this also increases hedging costs when currency options are used.6
Formulating a Currency Management Program 165
 
Exhibit 4: Hedge Fund Currency Management Policy: An Example
 
 
Overall Portfolio Benchmark: MSCI EAFE Index (local currency)
Currency Exposure Ranges: Foreign-currency exposures, based on the USD 
market value of the equities actually held by 
the fund at the beginning of each month, will 
be hedged back into USD within the following 
tolerance ranges of plus or minus: 
 ■EUR: 20%
 ■GBP: 15%
 ■JPY: 10%
 ■CHF: 10%
 ■AUD: 10%
 ■SEK: 10%
 Other currency exposures shall be left 
unhedged.
Rebalancing: The currency hedges will be rebalanced 
at least monthly, to reflect changes in the 
USD-denominated market value of portfolio 
equity holdings.
Hedging Instruments:  ■Forward contracts up to 12 months 
maturity;
 ■European put and call options can be bought 
or written, for maturities up to 12 months; 
and
 ■Exotic options of up to 12 months maturity 
can be bought or sold.
Reporting: Management will present quarterly reports 
to the board detailing net foreign-currency 
exposures and speculative trading results. 
Speculative trading results will be benchmarked 
against a 100% hedged currency exposure.
 
With this policy, Kailua Kona Advisors is indicating that it is willing to accept 
foreign-currency exposures within the portfolio but that these exposures must 
be kept within pre-defined limits. For example, suppose that at the beginning of 
the month the portfolio held EUR10 million of EUR-denominated assets. Also 
suppose that this EUR10 million exposure, combined with all the other for -
eign-currency exposures in the portfolio, matches Kailua Kona Advisors’ desired 
portfolio weights by currency (as a US-based fund, these desired percentage 
portfolio allocations across all currencies will be based in USD).
The currency-hedging guidelines indicate that the hedge (for example, using a 
short position in a USD/EUR forward contract) should be between EUR8 million 
and EUR12 million, giving some discretion to the portfolio manager on the size 
of the net exposure to the EUR. At the beginning of the next month, the USD 
values of the foreign assets in the portfolio are measured again, and the process 
repeats. If there has been either a large move in the foreign-currency value of the 
EUR-denominated assets and/or a large move in the USD/EUR exchange rate, it 
is possible that Kailua Kona Advisors’ portfolio exposure to EUR-denominated 
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 166
assets will be too far away from the desired percentage allocation.9 Kailua Kona 
Advisors will then need to either buy or sell EUR-denominated assets. If move -
ments in the EUR-denominated value of the assets or in the USD/EUR exchange 
rate are large enough, this asset rebalancing may have to be done before month’s 
end. Either way, once the asset rebalancing is done, it establishes the new EUR-
denominated asset value on which the currency hedge will be based (i.e., plus 
or minus 20% of this new EUR amount).
If the portfolio is not 100% hedged—for example, continuing the Kailua Kona 
illustration, if the portfolio manager only hedges EUR9 million of the exposure 
and has a residual exposure of being long EUR1 million—the success or failure 
of the manager’s tactical decision will be compared with a “neutral” benchmark. 
In this case, the comparison would be against the performance of a 100% fully 
hedged portfolio—that is, with a EUR10 million hedge.
ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS, TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 
AND THE CARRY TRADE
compare active currency trading strategies based on economic 
fundamentals, technical analysis, carry-trade, and volatility trading
describe how changes in factors underlying active trading strategies 
affect tactical trading decisions
The previous section discussed the strategic  decisions made by the IPS on locating the 
currency management practices of the portfolio along a risk spectrum ranging from a 
very conservative approach to currency risk to very active currency management. In 
this section, we consider the case in which the IPS has given the portfolio manager 
(or currency overlay manager) at least some limited discretion for actively managing 
currency risk within these mandated strategic bounds. This then leads to tactical  
decisions: which FX exposures to accept and manage within these discretionary limits. 
In other words, tactical decisions involve active currency management.
A market view is a prerequisite to any form of active management. At the heart 
of the trading decision in FX (and other) markets, lies a view on future market prices 
and conditions. This market opinion guides all decisions with respect to currency 
risk exposures, including whether currency hedges should be implemented and, if 
so, how they should be managed.
In what follows, we will explore some of the methods used to form directional views 
about the FX market. However, a word of caution that cannot be emphasized enough: 
There is no simple formula, model, or approach that will allow market participants 
to precisely forecast exchange rates (or any other financial prices) or to be able to be 
confident that any trading decision will be profitable .
9 The overall portfolio percentage allocations by currency will also depend on the price moves of all other  
foreign-currency assets and exchange rates as well, but we will simplify our example by ignoring this nuance.7
Economic Fundamentals, Technical Analysis and the Carry Trade 167
Active Currency Management Based on Economic 
Fundamentals
This section sets out a broad framework for developing a view about future exchange 
rate movements based on underlying fundamentals. In contrast to other methods for 
developing a market view (which are discussed in subsequent sections), at the heart 
of this approach is the assumption that, in a flexible exchange rate system, exchange 
rates are determined by logical economic relationships and that these relationships 
can be modeled.
The simple economic framework is based on the assumption that in the long run, 
the real exchange rate will converge to its “fair value, ” but short- to medium-term 
factors will shape the convergence path to this equilibrium.10
Recall that the real exchange rate reflects the ratio of the real purchasing power 
between two countries; that is, the once nominal purchasing power in each country 
is adjusted by its respective price level as well as the spot exchange rate between the 
two countries. The long-run equilibrium level for the real exchange rate is determined 
by purchasing power parity or some other model of an exchange rate’s fair value, and 
serves as the anchor for longer-term movements in exchange rates.
Over shorter time frames, movements in real exchange rates will also reflect 
movements in the real interest rate differential between countries. Recall that the real 
interest rate ( r) is the nominal interest rate adjusted by the expected inflation rate, or r 
= i − πε, where i is the nominal interest rate and πε is the expected inflation rate over 
the same term as the nominal and real interest rates. Movements in risk premiums 
will also affect exchange rate movements over shorter-term horizons. The riskier a 
country’s assets are perceived to be by investors, the more likely they are to move 
their investments out of that country, thereby depressing the exchange rate. Finally, 
the framework recognizes that there are two currencies involved in an exchange rate 
quote (the price and base currencies) and hence movements in exchange rates will 
reflect movements in the differentials  between these various factors.
As a result, all else equal, the base currency’s real exchange rate should appreciate 
if there is an upward movement in
 ■its long-run equilibrium real exchange rate;
 ■either its real or nominal interest rates, which should attract foreign capital;
 ■expected foreign inflation, which should cause the foreign currency to 
depreciate; and
 ■the foreign risk premium, which should make foreign assets less attractive 
compared with the base currency nation’s domestic assets.
The real exchange rate should also increase if it is currently below its long-term 
equilibrium value. All of this makes intuitive sense.
In summary, the exchange rate forecast is a mix of long-term, medium-term, and 
short-term factors. The long-run equilibrium real exchange rate is the anchor for 
exchange rates and the point of long-run convergence for exchange rate movements. 
Movements in the short- to medium-term factors (nominal interest rates, expected 
inflation) affect the timing and path of convergence to this long-run equilibrium. A 
stylized depiction of the price dynamics generated by this interaction between short-, 
medium-, and longer-term pricing factors is shown in Exhibit 5 .
10 This model was derived and explained by Rosenberg and Barker (2017) .

It needs to be stressed that it can be very demanding to model how each of these 
separate effects—nominal interest rate, expected inflation, and risk premium dif -
ferentials—change over time and affect exchange rates. It can also be challenging to 
model movements in the long-term equilibrium real exchange rate. A broad variety 
of factors, such as fiscal and monetary policy, will affect all of these variables in our 
simple economic model.11
Active Currency Management Based on Technical Analysis
Another approach to forming a market view is based on technical analysis. This 
approach is based on quite different assumptions compared with modeling based on 
economic fundamentals. Whereas classical exchange rate economics tends to view 
market participants as rational, markets as efficient, and exchange rates as driven by 
underlying economic factors, technical analysis ignores economic analysis. Instead, 
technical analysis is based on three broad themes.12
First, market technicians believe that in a liquid, freely traded market the histor -
ical price data can be helpful in projecting future price movements.13 The reason is 
because many traders have already used any useful data external to the market to 
generate their trading positions, so this information is already reflected in current 
prices. Therefore, it is not necessary to look outside of the market to form an opinion 
on future price movements. This means it is not necessary to examine interest rates, 
inflation rates, or risk premium differentials (the factors in our fundamentally based 
model) because exchange rates already incorporate these factors.
Second, market technicians believe that historical patterns in the price data have 
a tendency to repeat, and that this repetition provides profitable trade opportunities. 
These price patterns repeat because market prices reflect human behavior and human 
beings have a tendency to react in similar ways to similar situations, even if this 
repetitive behavior is not always fully rational. For example, when confronted with an 
11 A broader discussion of exchange rate economics can be found in Rosenberg and Barker (2017) .
12 Some material in this section is based on Sine and Strong (2012) .
13 In many other asset classes, technical analysis is based on trade volume data as well as price data. 
But there are no reliable, timely, and high-frequency trade volume data that are publicly available for 
over-the-counter (OTC) FX markets.
Economic Fundamentals, Technical Analysis and the Carry Trade 169
upward price trend, many market participants eventually come to believe that it will 
extrapolate (an attitude of “irrational exuberance” or “this time it is different”). When 
the trend eventually breaks, a panicked position exit can cause a sharp overshoot of 
fair value to the downside. Broadly speaking, technical analysis can be seen as the 
study of market psychology and how market participant emotions—primarily greed 
and fear—can be read from the price data and used to predict future price moves.
Third, technical analysis does not attempt to determine where market prices should  
trade (fair value, as in fundamental analysis) but where they will trade. Because these 
price patterns reflect trader emotions, they need not reflect—at least immediately—
any cool, rational assessment of the underlying economic or fundamental situation. 
Although market prices may eventually converge to fair value in the long run, the long 
run can be a very long time indeed. In the meanwhile, there are shorter-term trading 
opportunities available in trading the technical patterns in the price data.
Combined, these three principles of technical analysis define a discipline dedicated 
to identifying patterns in the historical price data, especially as it relates to identifying 
market trends and market turning points. (Technical analysis is less useful in a trendless 
market.) Technical analysis tries to identify when markets have become overbought  
or oversold , meaning that they have trended too far in one direction and are vulner -
able to a trend reversal, or correction. Technical analysis also tries to identify what 
are called support levels  and resistance levels , either within ongoing price trends 
or at their extremities (i.e., turning points). These support and resistance levels are 
price points on dealers’ order boards where one would except to see clustering of bids 
and offers, respectively. At these exchange rate levels, the price action is expected to 
get “sticky” because it will take more order flow to pierce the wall of either bids or 
offers. But once these price points are breached, the price action can be expected to 
accelerate as stops  are triggered. (Stops, in this sense, refer to stop-loss orders, in 
which traders leave resting bids or offers away from the current market price to be 
filled if the market reaches those levels. A stop-loss order is triggered when the price 
action has gone against a trader’s position, and it gets the trader out of that position 
to limit further losses.)
Technical analysis uses visual cues for market patterns as well as more quantitative 
technical indicators. There is a wide variety of technical indexes based on market prices 
that are used in this context. Some technical indicators are as simple as using moving 
averages of past price points. The 200-day moving average of daily exchange rates is 
often seen as an important indicator of likely support and resistance. Sometimes two 
moving averages are used to establish when a price trend is building momentum. For 
example, when the 50-day moving average crosses the 200-day moving average, this 
is sometimes seen as a price “break out” point.
Other technical indicators are based on more complex mathematical formulae. 
There is an extremely wide variety of these more mathematical indicators, some of 
them very esoteric and hard to connect intuitively with the behavior of real world 
financial market participants.
In summary, many FX active managers routinely use technical analysis—either 
alone or in conjunction with other approaches—to form a market opinion or to 
time position entry and exit points. Even though many technical indicators lack the 
intellectual underpinnings provided by formal economic modeling, they nonetheless 
remain a prominent feature of FX markets.

Active Currency Management Based on the Carry Trade
The carry trade  is a trading strategy of borrowing in low-yield currencies and investing 
in high-yield currencies. The term “carry” is related to what is known as the cost of 
carry—that is, of carrying or holding an investment. This investment has either an 
implicit or explicit cost (borrowing cost) but may also produce income. The net cost 
of carry is the difference between these two return rates.
If technical analysis is based on ignoring economic fundamentals, then the carry 
trade is based on exploiting a well-recognized violation of one of the international parity 
conditions often used to describe these economic fundamentals: uncovered interest rate 
parity. Recall that uncovered interest rate parity asserts that, on a longer-term average , 
the return on an unhedged foreign-currency asset investment will be the same as a 
domestic-currency investment. Assuming that the base currency in the P/B quote is 
the low-yield currency, stated algebraically uncovered interest rate parity asserts that
 % ΔSH/L ≈ iH − iL
where %Δ SH/L is the percentage change in the SH/L spot exchange rate (the 
low-yield currency is the base currency), iH is the interest rate on the high-yield cur -
rency and iL is the interest rate on the low-yield currency. If uncovered interest rate 
parity holds, the yield spread advantage  for the high-yielding currency (the right side 
of the equation) will, on average, be matched by the depreciation  of the high-yield 
currency (the left side of the equation; the low-yield currency is the base currency and 
hence a positive value for %Δ SH/L means a depreciation of the high-yield currency). 
According to the uncovered interest rate parity theorem, it is this offset between (1) 
the yield advantage and (2) the currency depreciation that equates, on average, the 
unhedged currency returns.
But in reality, the historical data show that there are persistent deviations from 
uncovered interest rate parity in FX markets, at least in the short to medium term. 
Indeed, high-yield countries often see their currencies appreciate , not depreciate, for 
extended periods of time. The positive returns from a combination of a favorable yield 
differential plus an appreciating currency can remain in place long enough to present 
attractive investment opportunities.
This persistent violation of uncovered interest rate parity described by the carry 
trade is often referred to as the forward rate bias . An implication of uncovered 
interest rate parity is that the forward rate should be an unbiased predictor of future 
spot rates. The historical data, however, show that the forward rate is not the center 
of the distribution for future spot rates; in fact, it is a biased  predictor (for example, 
see Kritzman 1999 ). Hence the name “forward rate bias. ” With the forward rate pre -
mium or discount defined as FP/B − SP/B the “bias” in the forward rate bias is that the 
premium typically overstates the amount of appreciation of the base currency, and 
the discount overstates the amount of depreciation. Indeed, the forward discount or 
premium often gets even the direction  of future spot rate movements wrong.
The carry trade strategy (borrowing in low-yield currencies, investing in high-yield 
currencies) is equivalent to a strategy based on trading the forward rate bias. Trading 
the forward rate bias involves buying currencies trading at a forward discount, and 
selling currencies trading at a forward premium. This makes intuitive sense: It is 
desirable to buy low and sell high.
To show the equivalence of the carry trade and trading the forward rate bias, recall 
that covered interest rate parity (which is enforced by arbitrage) is stated as
     F  P/B   −  S  P/B   _   S  P/B     =      (   i  p   −  i  B   )       (    t _ 360   )      ____________   
1 +  i  B     (    t _ 360   )       
Economic Fundamentals, Technical Analysis and the Carry Trade 171
This equation shows that when the base currency has a lower interest rate than the 
price currency (i.e., the right side of the equality is positive) the base currency will 
trade at a forward premium (the left side of the equality is positive). That is, being 
low-yield currency and trading at a forward premium is synonymous. Similarly, being 
a high-yield currency means trading at a forward discount. Borrowing in the low-yield 
currency and investing in the high-yield currency (the carry trade) is hence equivalent 
to selling currencies that have a forward premium and buying currencies that have a 
forward discount (trading the forward rate bias). We will return to these concepts in 
Section 9 when we discuss the roll yield in hedging with forward contracts. Exhibit 
6 summarizes several key points about the carry trade.

The gains that one can earn through the carry trade (or equivalently, through trad -
ing the forward rate bias) can be seen as the risk premiums earned for carrying an 
unhedged position—that is, for absorbing currency risk. (In efficient markets, there is 
no extra reward without extra risk.) Long periods of market stability can make these 
extra returns enticing to many investors, and the longer the yield differential persists 
between high-yield and low-yield currencies, the more carry trade positions will 
have a tendency to build up. But these high-yield currency advantages can be erased 
quickly, particularly if global financial markets are subject to sudden bouts of stress. 
This is especially true because the carry trade is a leveraged  position: borrowing in the 
low-yielding currency and investing in the high-yielding currency. These occasional 
large losses mean that the return distribution for the carry trade has a pronounced 
negative skew.
This negative skew derives from the fact that the funding currencies  of the carry 
trade (the low-yield currencies in which borrowing occurs) are typically the safe haven 
currencies, such as the EUR, CHF, and JPY. In contrast, the investment currencies  
(the high-yielding currencies) are typically currencies perceived to be higher risk, 
such as several emerging market currencies. Any time global financial markets are 
under stress there is a flight to safety that causes rapid movements in exchange rates, 
and usually a panicked unwinding of carry trades. As a result, traders running carry 
trades often get caught in losing positions, with the leverage involved magnifying 
their losses. Because of the tendency for long periods of relatively small gains in the 
carry trade to be followed by brief periods of large losses, the carry trade is some -
times characterized as “picking up nickels in front of a steamroller. ” One guide to the 
riskiness of the carry trade is the volatility of spot rate movements for the currency 
pair; all else equal, lower volatility is better for a carry trade position.
We close this section by noting that although the carry trade can be based on 
borrowing in a single funding currency and investing in a single high-yield currency, 
it is more common for carry trades to use multiple funding and investment currencies. 
The number of funding currencies and investment currencies need not be equal: for 
example, there could be five of one and three of the other. Sometimes the portfolio 
weighting of exposures between the various funding and investment currencies are 
simply set equal to each other. But the weights can also be optimized to reflect the 
trader’s market view of the expected movements in each of the exchange rates, as well 
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 172
as their individual risks (σ[%ΔS]) and the expected correlations between movements 
in the currency pairs. These trades can be dynamically rebalanced, with the relative 
weights among both funding and investment currencies shifting with market conditions.
VOLATILITY TRADING
compare active currency trading strategies based on economic 
fundamentals, technical analysis, carry-trade, and volatility trading
describe how changes in factors underlying active trading strategies 
affect tactical trading decisions
Another type of active trading style is unique to option markets and is known as vol -
atility trading (or simply “vol trading”).14 To explain this trading style, we will start 
with a quick review of some option basics.
The derivatives of the option pricing model show the sensitivity of the option’s 
premium to changes in the factors that determine option value. These derivatives are 
often referred to as the “Greeks” of option pricing. There is a very large number of 
first, second, third, and cross-derivatives that can be taken of an option pricing for -
mula, but the two most important Greeks that we will consider here are the following:
 ■Delta:  The sensitivity of the option premium to a small change in the price 
of the underlying15 of the option, typically a financial asset. This sensitivity 
is an indication of price  risk.
 ■Vega:  The sensitivity of the option premium to a small change in implied 
volatility. This sensitivity is an indication of volatility  risk.
The most important concept to grasp in terms of volatility trading is that the use 
of options allows the trader, through a variety of trading strategies, to unbundle  and 
isolate all of the various risk factors (the Greeks) and trade them separately. Once 
an initial option position is taken (either long or short), the trader has exposure to 
all of the various Greeks/risk factors. The unwanted risk exposures, however, can 
then be hedged away, leaving only  the desired risk exposure to express that specific 
directional view.
Delta hedging  is the act of hedging away the option position’s exposure to delta, 
the price risk of the underlying (the FX spot rate, in this case). Because delta shows the 
sensitivity of the option price to changes in the spot exchange rate, it thus defines the 
option’s hedge ratio: The size of the offsetting hedge position that will set the net delta 
of the combined position (option plus delta hedge) to zero. Typically implementing 
this delta hedge is done using either forward contracts or a spot transaction (spot, 
by definition, has a delta of one, and no exposure to any other of the Greeks; forward 
contracts are highly correlated with the spot rate). For example, if a trader was long a 
call option on USD/EUR with a nominal value of EUR1 million and a delta of +0.5, the 
delta hedge would involve a short forward position in USD/EUR of EUR0.5 million. 
That is, the size of the delta hedge is equal to the option’s delta times the nominal size 
of the contract. This hedge size would set the net delta of the overall position (option 
14 In principle, this trading style can be applied to all asset classes with options, not just FX trading. But 
FX options are the most liquid and widely traded options in the world, so it is in FX where most of volatility 
trading likely takes place in global financial markets.
15 The underlying asset of a derivative is typically referred to simply as the “underlying. ” 8
Volatility Trading 173
and forward) to zero.16 Once the delta hedge has set the net delta of the position 
to zero, the trader then has exposure only  to the other Greeks, and can use various 
trading strategies to position in these (long or short) depending on directional views.
Although one could theoretically trade any of the other Greeks, the most important 
one traded is vega; that is, the trader is expressing a view on the future movements in 
implied volatility, or in other words, is engaged in volatility trading. Implied volatility 
is not the same as realized, or observed, historical volatility, although it is heavily 
influenced by it. By engaging in volatility trading, the trader is expressing a view about 
the future volatility of exchange rates but not their direction  (the delta hedge set the 
net delta of the position to zero).
One simple option strategy that implements a volatility trade is a straddle , which 
is a combination of both an at-the-money (ATM) put and an ATM call. A long strad -
dle buys both of these options. Because their deltas are −0.5 and +0.5, respectively, 
the net delta of the position is zero; that is, the long straddle is delta neutral. This 
position is profitable in more volatile markets, when either the put or the call go 
sufficiently in the money to cover the upfront cost of the two option premiums paid. 
Similarly, a short straddle is a bet that the spot rate will stay relatively stable. In this 
case, the payout on any option exercise will be less than the twin premiums the seller 
has collected; the rest is net profit for the option seller. A similar option structure is a 
strangle  position for which a long position is buying out-of-the-money (OTM) puts 
and calls with the same expiry date and the same degree of being out of the money 
(we elaborate more on this subject later). Because OTM options are being bought, 
the cost of the position is cheaper—but conversely, it also does not pay off until the 
spot rate passes the OTM strike levels. As a result, the risk–reward for a strangle is 
more moderate than that for a straddle.
The interesting thing to note is that by using delta-neutral trading strategies, 
volatility is turned into a product that can be actively traded like any other financial 
product or asset class, such as equities, commodities, fixed-income products, and 
so on. Volatility is not constant nor are its movements completely random. Instead 
volatility is determined by a wide variety of underlying factors—both fundamental 
and technical—that the trader can express an opinion on. Movements in volatility are 
cyclical, and typically subject to long periods of relative stability punctuated by sharp 
upward spikes in volatility as markets come under periodic bouts of stress (usually the 
result of some dramatic event, financial or otherwise). Speculative vol traders—for 
example, among currency overlay managers—often want to be net-short volatility. 
The reason is because most options expire out of the money, and the option writer 
then gets to keep the option premium without delivery of the underlying currency 
pair. The amount of the option premium can be considered the risk premium, or pay -
ment, earned by the option writer for absorbing volatility risk. It is a steady source of 
income under “normal” market conditions. Ideally, these traders would want to “flip” 
their position and be long volatility ahead of volatility spikes, but these episodes can 
be notoriously difficult to time. Most hedgers typically run options positions that are 
net-long volatility because they are buying protection from unanticipated price vol -
atility. (Being long the option means being exposed to the time decay of the option’s 
time value; that is similar to paying insurance premiums for the protection against 
exchange rate volatility.)
We can also note that just as there are currency overlay  programs for actively 
trading the portfolio’s currency exposures (as discussed in Section 5) there can also 
be volatility overlay  programs for actively trading the portfolio’s exposures to move -
ments in currencies’ implied volatility. Just as currency overlay programs manage the 
16 Strictly speaking, the net delta would be approximately  equal to zero because forward contracts do not 
have identical price properties to those of the spot exchange rate. But it is close enough for our purposes 
here, and we will ignore this small difference.
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 174
portfolio’s exposure to currency delta (movements in spot exchange rates), volatility 
overlay programs manage the portfolio’s exposure to currency vega. These volatility 
overlay programs can be focused on earning speculative profits, but can also be used 
to hedge the portfolio against risk (we will return to this concept in the discussion of 
macro hedges in Section 11.).
Enumerating all the potential strategies for trading foreign exchange volatility 
is beyond the scope of this reading. Instead, the reader should be aware that this 
dimension of trading FX volatility (not price) exists and sees a large amount of active 
trading. Moreover, the best traders are able to think and trade in both dimensions 
simultaneously. Movements in volatility are often correlated with directional move -
ments in the price of the underlying. For example, when there is a flight to safety as 
carry trades unwind, there is typically a spike in volatility (and options prices) at the 
same time. Although pure vol trading is based on a zero-delta position, this need not 
always be the case; a trader can express a market opinion on volatility (vega exposure) 
and still have a directional exposure to the underlying spot exchange rate as well (delta 
exposure). That is, the overall trading position has net vega and delta exposures that 
reflect the joint  market view.
We end this section by explaining how currency options are quoted in professional 
FX markets. (This information will be used in Sections 9–12 when we discuss other 
option trading strategies.) Unlike exchanged-traded options, such as those used in 
equity markets, OTC options for currencies are not described in terms of specific 
strike levels (i.e., exchange rate levels). Instead, in the interdealer market, options are 
described in terms of their “delta. ” Deltas for puts can range from a minimum of −1 
to a maximum of 0, with a delta of −0.5 being the point at which the put option is 
ATM; OTM puts have deltas between 0 and −0.5. For call options, delta ranges from 
0 to +1, with 0.5 being the ATM point. In FX markets, these delta values are quoted 
both in absolute  terms (i.e., in positive rather than negative values) and as percentages, 
with standard FX option quotes usually in terms of 25-delta and 10-delta options (i.e., 
a delta of 0.25 and 0.10, respectively; the 10-delta option is deeper OTM and hence 
cheaper than the 25-delta option). The FX options market is the most liquid around 
these standard delta quoting points (ATM, 25-delta, 10-delta), but of course, as a 
flexible OTC market, options of any delta/strike price can be traded. The 25-delta put 
option (for example) will still go in the money if the spot price dips below a specific  
exchange rate level; this implied  strike price is backed out  of an option pricing model 
once all the other pricing factors, including the current spot rate and the 25-delta of 
the option, are put into the option pricing model. (The specific option pricing model 
used is agreed on by both parties to the trade.)
These standard delta price points are often used to define option trading strategies. 
For example, a 25-delta strangle would be based on 25-delta put and call options. 
Similarly, a 10-delta strangle would be based on 10-delta options (and would cost less 
and have a more moderate payoff structure than a 25-delta strangle). Labeling option 
structures by their delta is common in FX markets.
EXAMPLE 3
Active Strategies
Annie McYelland works as an analyst at Scotland-based Kilmarnock Advisors, an 
investment firm that offers several investment vehicles for its clients. McYelland 
has been put in charge of formulating the firm’s market views for some of the 
foreign currencies that these vehicles have exposures to. Her market views will 
be used to guide the hedging and discretionary positioning for some of the 
actively managed portfolios.
Volatility Trading 175
McYelland begins by examining yield spreads between various countries 
and the implied volatility extracted from the option pricing for several currency 
pairs. She collects the following data:
 
One-Y ear Yield Levels
Switzerland ‒0.80%
United States 0.30%
Poland 1.26%
Mexico 5.98%
 
 
One-Y ear Implied Volatility
PLN/CHF 7.58%
MXN/CHF 12.7%
MXN/PLN 11.8%
MXN/USD 9.81%
 
Note:  PLN = Polish zloty; the Swiss yields are negative because of Swiss policy actions.
McYelland is also examining various economic indicators to shape her market 
views. After studying the economic prospects for both Japan and New Zealand, 
she expects that the inflation rate for New Zealand is about to accelerate over 
the next few years, whereas the inflation rate for Japan should remain relatively 
stable. Turning her attention to the economic situation in India, McYelland 
believes that the Indian authorities are about to tighten monetary policy, and 
that this change has not been fully priced into the market. She reconsiders her 
short-term view for the Indian rupee (i.e., the INR/USD spot rate) after con -
ducting this analysis.
McYelland also examines the exchange rate volatility for several currency 
pairs to which the investment trusts are exposed. Based on her analysis of the 
situation, she believes that the exchange rate between Chilean peso and the US 
dollar (CLP/USD) is about to become much more volatile than usual, although 
she has no strong views about whether the CLP will appreciate or depreciate.
One of McYelland’s colleagues, Catalina Ortega, is a market technician and 
offers to help McYelland time her various market position entry and exit points 
based on chart patterns. While examining the JPY/NZD price chart, Ortega 
notices that the 200-day moving average is at 77.5035 and the current spot rate 
is 77.1905.
1. Based on the data she collected, all else equal, McYelland’s best option for 
implementing a carry trade position would be to fund in:
A. USD and invest in MXN.
B. CHF and invest in MXN.
C. CHF and invest in PLN.
Solution to 1:
A is correct. The tradeoff between the yield spread between the funding and 
investment currencies and the implied volatility (risk) is the most attractive. 
The other choices have a narrower yield spread and higher risk (implied 
volatility).
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 176
2. Based on McYelland’s inflation forecasts, all else equal, she would be more 
likely  to expect a(n):
A. depreciation in the JPY/NZD.
B. increase in capital flows from Japan to New Zealand.
C. more accommodative monetary policy by the Reserve Bank of New 
Zealand.
Solution to 2:
A is correct. All else equal, an increase in New Zealand’s inflation rate will 
decrease its real interest rate and lead to the real interest rate differential 
favoring Japan over New Zealand. This would likely result in a depreciation 
of the JPY/NZD rate over time. The shift in the relative real returns should 
lead to reduced capital flows from Japan to New Zealand (so Choice B is 
incorrect) and the RBNZ—New Zealand’s central bank—is more likely to 
tighten monetary policy than loosen it as inflation picks up (so Choice C is 
incorrect).
3. Given her analysis for India, McYelland’s short-term market view for the 
INR/USD spot rate is now most likely  to be:
A. biased toward appreciation.
B. biased toward depreciation.
C. unchanged because it is only a short-run view.
Solution to 3:
B is correct. Tighter monetary policy in India should lead to higher real 
interest rates (at least in the short run). This increase will cause the INR 
to appreciate against the USD, but because the USD is the base currency, 
this will be represented as depreciation in the INR/USD rate. Choice C is 
incorrect because a tightening of monetary policy that is not fully priced-in 
to market pricing is likely to move bond yields and hence the exchange rate 
in the short run (given the simple economic model in Section 7).
4. Using CLP/USD options, what would be the cheapest  way for McYelland to 
implement her market view for the CLP?
A. Buy a straddle
B. Buy a 25-delta strangle
C. Sell a 40-delta strangle
Solution to 4:
B is correct. Either a long straddle or a long strangle will profit from a 
marked increase in volatility in the spot rate, but a 25-delta strangle would 
be cheaper (because it is based on OTM options). Writing a strangle—par -
ticularly one that is close to being ATM, which is what a 40-delta structure 
is—is likely to be exercised in favor of the counterparty if McYelland’s mar -
ket view is correct.
5. Based on Ortega’s analysis, she would most likely  expect:
A. support near 77.5035.
B. resistance near 77.1095.
C. resistance near 77.5035.
Forward Contracts, FX Swaps, and Currency Options 177
Solution to 5:
C is correct. The 200-day moving average has not been crossed yet, and it 
is higher than the current spot rate. Hence this technical indicator suggests 
that resistance lies above the current spot rate level, likely in the 77.5035 
area. Choice A is incorrect because the currency has not yet appreciated to 
77.5035, so it cannot be considered a “support” level. Given that the curren -
cy pair has already traded through 77.1905 and is still at least 90 pips away 
from the 200-day moving average, it is more likely to suspect that resistance 
still lies above the current spot rate.
FORWARD CONTRACTS, FX SWAPS, AND CURRENCY 
OPTIONS
describe how forward contracts and FX (foreign exchange) swaps are 
used to adjust hedge ratios
In this section, we focus on how the portfolio manager uses financial derivatives to 
implement both the strategic  positioning of the portfolio along the risk spectrum 
(i.e., the performance benchmark) as well as the tactical  decisions made in regard 
to variations around this “neutral” position. The manager’s market view—whether 
based on carry, fundamental, currency volatility, or technical considerations—leads 
to this active management of risk positioning around the strategic benchmark point. 
Implementing both strategic and tactical viewpoints requires the use of trading tools, 
which we discuss in this section.
The balance of this reading will assume that the portfolio’s strategic foreign-currency 
asset exposures and the maximum amount of currency risk desired have already been 
determined by the portfolio’s IPS. We begin at the conservative end of the risk spectrum 
by describing a passive hedge for a single currency (with a 100% hedge ratio). After 
discussing the costs and limitations of this approach, we move out further along the 
risk spectrum by describing strategies in which the basic “building blocks” of financial 
derivatives can be combined to implement the manager’s tactical positioning and 
construct much more customized risk–return profiles. Not surprisingly, the basic 
trading tools themselves—forwards, options, FX swaps—are used for both strategic 
and tactical risk management and by both hedgers and speculators alike (although for 
different ends). Note that the instruments covered as tools of currency management 
are not nearly an exhaustive list. For example, exchange-traded funds for currencies 
are a vehicle that can be useful in managing currency risk.
Forward Contracts
In this section, we consider the most basic form of hedging: a 100% hedge ratio for a 
single foreign-currency exposure. Futures or forward contracts on currencies can be 
used to obtain full currency hedges, although most institutional investors prefer to 
use forward contracts for the following reasons:
1. Futures contracts are standardized in terms of settlement dates and contract 
sizes. These may not correspond to the portfolio’s investment parameters.9
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 178
2. Futures contracts may not always be available in the currency pair that 
the portfolio manager wants to hedge. For example, the most liquid cur -
rency futures contracts trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). 
Although there are CME futures contracts for all major exchange rates (e.g., 
USD/EUR, USD/GBP) and many cross rates (e.g., CAD/EUR, JPY/CHF), 
there are not contracts available for all possible currency pairs. Trading 
these cross rates would need multiple futures contracts, adding to port -
folio management costs. In addition, many of the “second tier” emerging 
market currencies may not have liquid futures contracts available against 
any currency, let alone the currency pair in which the portfolio manager is 
interested.
3. Futures contracts require up-front margin (initial margin). They also have 
intra-period cash flow implications, in that the exchange will require the 
investor to post additional variation margin when the spot exchange rate 
moves against the investor’s position. These initial and ongoing margin 
requirements tie up the investor’s capital and require careful monitoring 
through time, adding to the portfolio management expense. Likewise, 
margin flows can go in the investor’s favor, requiring monitoring and 
reinvestment.
In contrast, forward contracts do not suffer from any of these drawbacks. Major 
global investment dealers (such as Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, etc.) 
will quote prices on forward contracts for practically every possible currency pair, 
settlement date, and transaction amount. They typically do not require margin to be 
posted or maintained.
Moreover, the daily trade volume globally for OTC currency forward and swap 
contracts dwarfs that for exchange-traded currency futures contracts; that is, for -
ward contracts are more liquid than futures for trading in large sizes. Reflecting this 
liquidity, forward contracts are the predominant hedging instrument in use globally. 
For the balance of this section, we will focus only on currency forward contracts. 
However, separate side boxes discuss exchange-traded currency futures contracts 
and currency-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Hedge Ratios with Forward Contracts
In principle, setting up a full currency hedge is relatively straight forward: match the 
current market value of the foreign-currency exposure in the portfolio with an equal 
and offsetting position in a forward contract. In practice, of course, it is not that sim -
ple because the market value of the foreign-currency assets will change with market 
conditions. This means that the actual hedge ratio will typically drift  away from the 
desired hedge ratio as market conditions change. A static hedge  (i.e., unchanging 
hedge) will avoid transaction costs, but will also tend to accumulate unwanted currency 
exposures as the value of the foreign-currency assets change. This characteristic will 
cause a mismatch between the market value of the foreign-currency asset portfolio 
and the nominal size of the forward contract used for the currency hedge; this is pure 
currency risk. For this reason, the portfolio manager will typically need to implement 
a dynamic hedge  by rebalancing the portfolio periodically. This hedge rebalancing 
will mean adjusting some combination of the size, number, and maturities of the 
forward currency contracts.
A simple example will illustrate this rebalancing process. Suppose that an investor 
domiciled in Switzerland has a EUR-denominated portfolio that, at the start of the 
period, is worth EUR1,000,000. Assume a monthly hedge-rebalancing cycle. To hedge 
this portfolio, the investor would sell EUR1,000,000 one month forward against the 
CHF. Assume that one month later, the EUR-denominated investment portfolio is 
then actually worth only EUR950,000. To roll the hedge forward for the next month, 
Forward Contracts, FX Swaps, and Currency Options 179
the investor will engage in a mismatched FX swap. (Recall that a “matched” swap 
means that both the spot and forward transactions—the near and far “legs” of the 
swap, respectively—are of equal size). For the near leg of the swap, EUR1 million will 
be bought at spot to settle the expiring forward contract. (The euro amounts will 
then net to zero, but a Swiss franc cash flow will be generated, either a loss or a gain 
for the investor, depending on how the CHF/EUR rate has changed over the month). 
For the far leg of the swap, the investor will sell EUR950,000 forward for one month.
Another way to view this rebalancing process is to consider the case in which the 
original short forward contract has a three-month maturity. In this case, rebalancing 
after one month would mean that the manager would have to buy 50,000 CHF/EUR 
two months forward. There is no cash flow at the time this second forward contract 
is entered, but the net amount of euro for delivery at contract settlement two months 
into the future is now the euro hedge amount desired (i.e., EUR950,000). There will 
be a net cash flow (denominated in CHF) calculated over these two forward contracts 
on the settlement date two months hence.
Although rebalancing a dynamic hedge will keep the actual hedge ratio close to the 
target hedge ratio, it will also lead to increased transaction costs compared with a static 
hedge. The manager will have to assess the cost–benefit trade-offs of how frequently 
to dynamically rebalance the hedge. These will depend on a variety of idiosyncratic 
factors (manager risk aversion, market view, IPS guidelines, etc.), and so there is no 
single “correct” answer—different managers will likely make different decisions.
However, we can observe that the higher the degree of risk aversion, the more fre -
quently the hedge is likely to be rebalanced back to the “neutral” hedge ratio. Similarly, 
the greater the tolerance for active trading, and the stronger the commitment to a 
particular market view, the more likely it is that the actual hedge ratio will be allowed 
to vary from a “neutral” setting, possibly through entering into new forward contracts. 
(For example, if the P/B spot rate was seen to be oversold and likely to rebound higher, 
an actively traded portfolio might buy the base currency through forward contracts to 
lock in this perceived low price—and thus change the actual hedge ratio accordingly.) 
The sidebar on executing a hedge illustrates the concepts of rolling hedges, FX swaps 
and their pricing (bid–offer), and adjusting hedges for market views and changes in 
market values.
EXECUTING A HEDGE
Jiao Yang works at Hong Kong SAR-based Kwun Tong Investment Advisors; its 
reporting currency is the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD). She has been put in charge 
of managing the firm’s foreign-currency hedges. Forward contracts for two of 
these hedges are coming due for settlement, and Yang will need to use FX swaps 
to roll these hedges forward three months.
Hedge #1 : Kwun Tong has a short position of JPY800,000,000 coming 
due on a JPY/HKD forward contract. The market value of the underlying 
foreign-currency assets has not changed over the life of the contract, and 
Yang does not have a firm opinion on the expected future movement in 
the JPY/HKD spot rate.
Hedge #2 : Kwun Tong has a short position of EUR8,000,000 coming 
due on a HKD/EUR forward contract. The market value of the EUR-
denominated assets has increased (measured in EUR). Yang expects the 
HKD/EUR spot rate to decrease.
The following spot exchange rates and three-month forward points are in 
effect when Yang transacts the FX swaps necessary to roll the hedges forward:
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 180
 
  Spot Rate Three-Month Forward Points
JPY/HKD 14.4/14.4 −1.2/−1.1
HKD/EUR 9.0200/9.0210 173/176
 
Note:  The JPY/HKD forward points will be scaled by 100; the HKD/EUR forward points will be 
scaled by 10,000
As a result, Yang undertakes the following transactions:
For Hedge #1 , the foreign-currency value of the underlying assets has not 
changed, and she does not have a market view that would lead her to want to 
either over- or under-hedge the foreign-currency exposure. Therefore, to roll 
these hedges forward, she uses a matched swap. For matched swaps (see Section 
2), the convention is to base pricing on the mid-market spot exchange rate. 
Thus, the spot leg of the swap would be to buy JPY800,000,000 at the mid-mar -
ket rate of 10.81 JPY/HKD. The forward leg of the swap would require selling 
JPY800,000,000 forward three months. Selling JPY (the price currency in the 
JPY/HKD quote) is equivalent to buying HKD (the base currency). Therefore, 
she uses the offer-side forward points, and the all-in forward rate for the forward 
leg of the swap is as follows:
  14.41  +   − 1.1 _ 100   = 14.40  
For Hedge #2 , the foreign-currency value of the underlying assets has increased; 
Yang recognizes that this implies that she should increase the size of the hedge 
greater than EUR8,000,000. She also believes that the HKD/EUR spot rate will 
decrease, and recognizes that this implies a hedge ratio of more than 100% (Kwun 
Tong Advisors has given her discretion to over- or under-hedge based on her 
market views). This too means that the size of the hedge should be increased 
more than EUR8,000,000, because Yang will want a larger short position in the 
EUR to take advantage of its expected depreciation. Hence, Yang uses a mis -
matched swap, buying EUR8,000,000 at spot rate against the HKD, to settle the 
maturing forward contract and then selling  an amount more  than EUR8,000,000 
forward to increase the hedge size. Because the EUR is the base currency in the 
HKD/EUR quote, this means using the bid side for both the spot rate and the 
forward points when calculating the all-in forward rate:
  9.0200  +   173 _ 10, 000   = 9.0373  
The spot leg of the swap—buying back EUR8,000,000 to settle the outstanding 
forward transaction—is also based on the bid rate of 9.0200. This is because Yang 
is selling an amount larger than EUR8,000,000 forward, and the all-in forward 
rate of the swap is already using the bid side of the market (as it would for a 
matched swap). Hence, to pick up the net increase in forward EUR sales, the 
dealer Yang is transacting with would price the swap so that Yang also has to use 
bid side of the spot quote for the spot transaction used to settle the maturing 
forward contract.
Roll Yield
The roll yield (also called the roll return) on a hedge results from the fact that forward 
contracts are priced at the spot rate adjusted for the number of forward points at 
that maturity (see the example shown in Exhibit 3 ). This forward point adjustment 
Forward Contracts, FX Swaps, and Currency Options 181
can either benefit or detract from portfolio returns (positive and negative roll yield, 
respectively) depending on whether the forward points are at a premium or discount, 
and what side of the market (buying or selling) the portfolio manager is on.
The concept of roll yield is illustrated with the simplified example shown in Exhibit 
7.
Exhibit 7: The Forward Curve and Roll Yield
FP/B
A
B
Time to SettlementForwar d
Curve
The magnitude of roll yield is given by |( FP/B ‒ SP/B)/SP/B| where “||” indicates abso -
lute value. The sign depends on whether the investor needs to buy or to sell the base 
currency forward in order to maintain the hedge. A positive  roll yield results from 
buying the base currency at a forward discount or selling it at a forward premium 
(the intuition here is that it is profitable to “buy low and sell high”). Otherwise, the 
roll yield is negative (i.e., a positive cost). Examining the case of negative roll yield, 
assume that to implement the hedge requires buying the base currency in the P/B 
quote, and that the base currency is trading at a forward premium (as shown in 
Exhibit 7 ). By using a long position in a forward contract to implement this hedge, it 
means paying the forward price of A. All else equal, as time passes the price of the 
forward contract will “roll down the curve” toward Price B as the forward contract’s 
settlement date approaches. (Note that in reality the curve is not always linear.) At the 
settlement date of the forward contract, it is necessary to roll the hedging position 
forward to extend the currency hedge. This rolling forward will involve selling the 
base currency at the then-current spot exchange rate to settle the forward contract, 
and then going long another far-dated forward contract (i.e., an FX swap transaction). 
Note that the portfolio manager originally bought the base currency at Price A and 
then subsequently sold it at a lower Price B—and that buying high and selling low 
will be a cost to the portfolio. Or put differently, all else equal, the roll yield would 
be negative in this case. Note that the “all else equal” caveat refers to the fact that 
the all-in price of the forward contract consists of the spot rate and forward points, 
and both are likely to change over the life of the forward contract. It is possible that 
at the settlement date the spot rate would have moved higher than A, in which case 
the roll yield would be positive. But the larger the gap between A and B at contract 
initiation, the less likely this is to occur.
The concept of roll yield is very similar to the concept of forward rate bias (and the 
carry trade) introduced in Sections 7–8. Indeed, a negative roll yield typically indicates 
that the hedger was trading against  the forward rate bias by buying a currency at a 
forward premium (as in Exhibit 7 ) or selling a currency at a forward discount. This 
is the exact opposite of trading the forward rate bias, which is to buy at a discount 
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 182
and sell at a premium. Given the equivalence between the forward rate bias and the 
carry trade, by trading against the forward rate bias the hedger with a negative roll 
yield is also essentially entering into negative  carry trade, in effect borrowing at high 
rates and investing at low rates. On average, this will not be a winning strategy. Given 
the equivalence between implementing a carry trade, trading the forward rate bias, 
and earning positive roll yield, we can now complete Exhibit 6  introduced in Section 
7 on the carry trade:

tive roll yield Trading the forward

currency
Note as well that this concept of roll yield applies to forward and futures contracts 
used to trade any asset class, not just currencies: It applies equally well to forwards and 
futures on equities, fixed-income securities, commodities, and indeed, any financial 
product. For example, consider the case of a commodity processor that hedges the 
costs of its production process by going long corn futures contracts. If the futures 
curve for corn futures contracts is in contango (upward sloping, as in Exhibit 7 ), then 
this hedging position will also face the potential for negative roll yield.
To be fair, it is also possible for the level of, and movement in, forward points to 
be in the portfolio manager’s favor. Extending our previous example, consider the case 
of a portfolio manager that has to sell the base currency to implement the currency 
hedge. In this case, the manager would be selling the base currency forward at Price 
A in Exhibit 7  and, all else equal and through entering an FX swap at settlement date, 
buying the currency back at the lower Price B—essentially, short selling a financial 
product with a declining price. In this case, the roll yield is positive.
Because the level of and movements in forward points can either enhance or 
reduce currency-hedged returns, it explains an observed tendency in foreign exchange 
markets for the amount of currency hedging to generally vary with movements in 
forward points. As forward points move against the hedger, the amount of hedging 
activity typically declines as the cost/benefit ratio of the currency hedge deteriorates. 
The opposite occurs when movements in forward points reduce hedging costs. 
Essentially the tendency to hedge will vary depending on whether implementing the 
hedge happens to be trading in the same direction of the forward rate bias strategy 
or against it. It is easier to sell a currency forward if there is a “cushion” when it is 
selling at a forward premium. Likewise, it is more attractive to buy a currency when 
it is trading at a forward discount. This swings the forward rate bias (and carry trade 
advantage) in favor of the hedge.
Combined with the manager’s market view of future spot rate movements, what 
this concept implies is that, when setting the hedge ratio, the portfolio manager must 
balance the effect of expected future exchange rate movements on portfolio returns 
against the expected effect of the roll yield (i.e., the expected cost of the hedge).
A simple example can illustrate this effect. Consider a portfolio manager that needs 
to sell forward the base currency of a currency pair (P/B) to implement a currency 
hedge. Clearly, the manager would prefer to sell this currency at as high a price as 
possible. Assume that given the forward points for this currency pair and the time 
horizon for the hedge, the expected roll yield (cost of the hedge) is −3%. Suppose the 
Forward Contracts, FX Swaps, and Currency Options 183
portfolio manager had a market view that the base currency would depreciate by 4%. 
In this case, the hedge makes sense: It is better to pay 3% for the hedge to avoid an 
expected 4% loss.
Now, suppose that with a movement in forward points the new forward discount 
on the base currency is 6% away from the current spot rate. If the manager’s market 
view is unchanged (an expected depreciation of the base currency of 4%), then now the 
use of the hedge is less clear: Does it make sense to pay 6% for the hedge to avoid an 
expected 4% loss? A risk-neutral  manager would not hedge under these circumstances 
because the net expected value of the hedge is negative. But a risk-averse  manager 
might still implement the hedge regardless of the negative net expected value. The 
reason is because it is possible that the market forecast is wrong and that the actual  
depreciation of the base currency (and realized loss to the portfolio) may be higher 
than the 6% cost of the hedge. The risk-averse manager must then weigh the certainty  
of a hedge that costs 6% against the risk that actual unhedged currency losses might 
be much higher than that.
Clearly, the cost/benefit analysis has shifted against hedging in this case, but many 
risk-averse investors would still undertake the hedge anyway. The risk-averse manager 
would likely only take an unhedged currency position if the difference between the 
expected cost of the hedge and the expected return on an unhedged position was 
so great as to make the risk acceptable. Balancing these two considerations would 
depend on the type of market view the manager held and the degree of conviction in 
it, as well as the manager's degree of risk aversion. The decision taken will vary among 
investors, so no definitive answer can be given as to what would be the appropriate 
hedging choice (different portfolio managers will make different choices given the 
same opportunity set). But hedging costs will vary with market conditions and the 
higher the expected cost of the hedge (negative roll yield) the more the cost/benefit 
calculation moves against using a fully hedged position. Or put another way, if setting 
up the hedge involves selling the low-yield currency and buying the high-yield currency 
in the P/B pair (i.e., an implicit carry position), then the more likely the portfolio will 
be fully hedged or even over-hedged. The opposite is also true: Trading against the 
forward rate bias is likely to lead to lower hedge ratios, all else equal.
EXAMPLE 4
The Hedging Decision
The reporting currency of Hong Kong SAR-based Kwun Tong Investment 
Advisors is the Hong Kong dollar (HKD). The investment committee is exam -
ining whether it should implement a currency hedge for the firm’s exposures 
to the GBP and the ZAR (the firm has long exposures to both of these foreign 
currencies). The hedge would use forward contracts. The following data relevant 
to assessing the expected cost of the hedge and the expected move in the spot 
exchange rate has been developed by the firm’s market strategist.
 
 
Current Spot RateSix-Month Forward 
RateSix-Month Forecast 
Spot Rate
HKD/GBP 10.6000 10.5895 10.2000
HKD/ZAR 0.5210 0.5082 0.5100
 
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 184
1. Recommend whether to hedge the firm’s long GBP exposure. Justify your 
recommendation.
Solution to 1:
Kwun Tong is long the GBP against the HKD, and HKD/GBP is selling at 
a small forward discount of −0.106% compared with the current spot rate. 
All else equal, this is the expected roll yield—which is not in the firm’s favor, 
in this case, because to implement the hedge Kwun Tong would be selling  
GBP , the base currency in the quote, at a price lower  than the current spot 
rate. However, the firm’s market strategist expects the GBP to depreciate  by 
3.92% against the HKD. Thus, the negative carry of hedging is small in com -
parison to the potential loss. Both of these considerations argue for hedging 
this exposure.
2. Discuss the trade-offs in hedging the firm’s long ZAR exposure.
Solution to 2:
Kwun Tong is long the ZAR against the HKD, and HKD/ZAR is selling at a 
forward discount of −2.5% compared with the current spot rate. Implement -
ing the hedge would require the firm to sell the base currency in the quote, 
the ZAR, at a price lower  than the current spot rate. This would imply that, 
all else equal, the roll yield would go against the firm; that is, the expected 
cost of the hedge would be 2.5%. But the firm’s strategist also forecasts that 
the ZAR will depreciate against the HKD by 2.2%. This makes the decision 
to hedge less certain. A risk-neutral investor would not hedge because the 
expected cost of the hedge is more than the expected depreciation of the 
ZAR. But this is only a point forecast and comes with a degree of uncer -
tainty—there is a risk that the HKD/ZAR spot rate might depreciate by 
more than the 2.5% cost of the hedge. In this case, the decision to hedge the 
currency risk would depend on the trade-offs between (1) the level of risk 
aversion of the firm; and (2) the conviction the firm held in the currency 
forecast—that is, the level of certainty that the ZAR would not depreciate by 
more than 2.5%.
Currency Options
One of the costs of forward contracts is the opportunity cost. Once fully hedged, the 
portfolio manager forgoes any upside potential for future currency moves in the port -
folio’s favor. Currency options remove this opportunity cost because they provide the 
manager the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell foreign exchange at a future 
date at a rate agreed on today. The manager will only exercise the option at the expiry 
date if it is favorable to do so.17
Consider the case of a portfolio manager who is long the base currency in the 
P/B quote and needs to sell this currency to implement the hedge. One approach is 
to simply buy an at-the-money put option on the P/B currency pair. Matching a long 
position in the underlying with a put option is known as a protective put  strategy. 
Suppose the current spot rate is 1.3650 and the strike price on the put option bought 
is 1.3650. If the P/B rate subsequently goes down (P appreciates and B depreciates) 
by the expiry date, the manager can exercise the option, implement the hedge, and 
17 Almost all options in the FX market are European-style options, which only allow for exercise at the 
expiry date.
Forward Contracts, FX Swaps, and Currency Options 185
guarantee a selling price of 1.3650. But if the P/B rate increases (P depreciates and B 
appreciates), the manager can simply let the option expire and collect the currency 
gains.
Unfortunately, like forward contracts, currency options are not “free goods” and, 
like any form of insurance, there is always a price to be paid for it. Buying an option 
means paying an upfront premium. This premium is determined, first, by its intrinsic 
value , which is the difference between the spot exchange rate and the strike price of 
the option (i.e., whether the option is in the money, at the money, or out of the money, 
respectively). ATM options are more expensive than OTM options, and frequently 
these relatively expensive options expire without being exercised.
The second determinant of an option’s premium is its time value , which in turn 
is heavily influenced by the volatility in exchange rates. Regardless of exchange rate 
volatility, however, options are always moving toward expiry. In general, the time value 
of the option is always declining. This is the time decay of the option’s value (theta, 
one of the “Greeks” of option prices, describes this effect) and is similar in concept to 
that of negative roll yield on forward contracts described earlier. Time decay always 
works against the owner of an option.
As with forward contracts, a portfolio manager will have to make judgments about 
the cost/benefit trade-offs of options-based strategies. Although options do allow the 
portfolio upside potential from favorable currency movements, options can also be a 
very expensive form of insurance. The manager will have to balance any market view 
of potential currency gains against hedging costs and the degree of risk aversion. There 
is no “right” answer; different managers will make different decisions about the cost/
benefit trade-offs when given the same opportunity set.
EXAMPLE 5
Hedging Problems
Brixworth & St. Ives Asset Management is a UK-based firm managing a dynamic 
hedging program for the currency exposures in its Aggressive Growth Fund. 
One of the fund’s foreign-currency asset holdings is denominated in the Mexican 
peso (MXN), and one month ago Brixworth & St. Ives fully hedged this exposure 
using a two-month MXN/GBP forward contract. The following table provides 
the relevant information.
 
  One Month Ago Today
Value of assets (in MXN) 10,000,000 9,500,000
MXN/GBP spot rate (bid–offer) 29.0500/29.0580 27.5985/28.0065
One-month forward points (bid–offer) 1,475/1,510 1,500/1,536
Two-month forward points (bid–offer) 2,590/2,650 2,640/2,700
 
The Aggressive Growth Fund also has an unhedged foreign-currency asset 
exposure denominated in the South African rand (ZAR). The current mid-market 
spot rate in the ZAR/GBP currency pair is 20.1050.
1. One month ago, Brixworth & St. Ives most likely  sold:
A. MXN9,500,000 forward at an all-in forward rate of MXN/GBP 
19.6635.
B. MXN10,000,000 forward at an all-in forward rate of MXN/GBP 
29.3090.
C. MXN10,000,000 forward at an all-in forward rate of MXN/GBP 
29.3230.
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 186
Solution to 1:
C is correct. Brixworth & St. Ives is long the MXN and hence must sell the 
MXN forward against the GBP . Selling MXN against the GBP means buying 
GBP , the base currency in the MXN/GBP quote. Therefore, the offer side 
of the market must be used. This means the all-in rate used one month ago 
would have been 29.058 + 2,650/10,000, which equals 29.3230. Choice A 
is incorrect because it uses today’s asset value and the incorrect forward 
quotes and Choice B is incorrect because it uses the wrong side of the mar -
ket (the bid side).
2. To rebalance the hedge today, the firm would most likely  need to:
A. buy MXN500,000 spot.
B. buy MXN500,000 forward.
C. sell MXN500,000 forward.
Solution to 2:
B is correct. The foreign investment went down in value in MXN terms. 
Therefore Brixworth & St. Ives must reduce the size of the hedge. Previously 
it had sold MXN10,000,000 forward against the GBP , and this amount must 
be reduced to MXN9,500,000 by buying MXN500,000 forward. Choice A 
is incorrect because hedging is done with forward contracts not spot deals. 
Choice C is incorrect because selling MXN forward would increase the size 
of the hedge, not decrease it.
3. Given the data in the table, the roll yield on this hedge at the forward con -
tracts’ maturity date is most likely  to be:
A. zero.
B. negative.
C. positive.
Solution to 3:
B is correct. To implement the hedge, Brixworth & St. Ives must sell MXN 
against the GBP , or equivalently, buy GBP (the base currency in the P/B 
quote) against the MXN. The base currency is selling forward at a premi -
um, and—all else equal—its price would “roll down the curve” as contract 
maturity approached. Having to settle the forward contract means then 
selling the GBP spot at a lower price. Buying high and selling low will define 
a negative roll yield. Moreover, the GBP has depreciated against the MXN, 
because the MXN/GBP spot rate declined between one month ago and now, 
which will also add to the negative roll yield.
4. Assuming that all ZAR/GBP options considered have the same notional 
amount and maturity, the most  expensive hedge that Brixworth & St. Ives 
could use to hedge its ZAR exposure is a long position in a(n):
A. ATM GBP call.
B. 25-delta GBP call.
C. GBP put with a strike of 20.1050.
Solution to 4:
A is correct. The Aggressive Growth Fund is long the ZAR through its 
foreign-currency assets, and to hedge this exposure it must sell the ZAR 
Currency Management Strategies 187
against the GBP , or equivalently, buy GBP—the base currency in the P/B 
quote—against the ZAR. Hedging a required purchase means a long posi -
tion in a call option (not a put, which is used to hedge a required sale of the 
base currency in the P/B quote). An ATM call option is more expensive than 
a 25-delta call option.
CURRENCY MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES
describe trading strategies used to reduce hedging costs and modify 
the risk–return characteristics of a foreign-currency portfolio
In the previous sections, we showed that completely hedging currency risk is possible—
but can also be expensive. It can be even more expensive when trying to avoid all 
downside risk while keeping the full upside potential for favorable currency movements 
(i.e., a protective put strategy with ATM options). Hedging can be seen as a form of 
insurance, but it is possible to overpay for insurance. Judgments have to be made to 
determine at what point the costs outweigh the benefits.
As with any form of insurance, there are always steps that can be taken to reduce 
hedging costs. For most typical insurance products, these cost-reduction measures 
include such things as higher deductibles, co-pay arrangements, and lower maximum 
payouts. The same sorts of measures exist in the FX derivatives market; we will explore 
these various alterative measures in this section. The key point to keep in mind is that 
all of these various cost-reduction measures invariably involve some combination of 
less downside protection  and/or less upside potential  for the hedge. In efficient markets, 
lower insurance premiums mean lower insurance.
These cost-reduction measures also start moving the portfolio away from a passively 
managed 100% hedge ratio toward discretionary hedging in which the manager is 
allowed to take directional positions. Once the possibility of accepting some downside 
risk, and some upside potential, is introduced into the portfolio, the manager is moving 
away from a rules-based approach to hedging toward a more active style of trading. 
The portfolio manager can then use the trading tools and strategies described in the 
following sections to express a market view and/or cut hedging costs.
The variety of trading strategies—involving various combinations of forwards, 
options, and swaps—that can be deployed to this end is almost infinite. We will not 
attempt to explore all of them in this reading, but rather to give a sense of the range 
of trading tools and strategies available for managing currency risk. We begin with 
Exhibit 9 , which gives a high-level description of some of these various trading strat -
egies that will then be explained in more detail in subsequent sections. Note that as 
this section progresses, we will be describing strategies at different points along the 
risk spectrum described in Sections 4–6, moving in turn from passive hedge-based 
approaches to strategies used in more active currency management schemes.

We will make one simplifying assumption for the following sections. Currency man -
agement strategies will differ fundamentally depending on whether the base currency 
of the P/B price quote must be bought or sold to decrease the foreign-currency 
exposure. To simplify the material and impose consistency on the discussions that 
follow, we will assume that the portfolio manager must sell the base currency in the 
P/B quote to reduce currency risk. In addition, unless otherwise noted, the notional 
amounts and expiration dates on all forward and options contracts are the same.18
Over-/Under-Hedging Using Forward Contracts
When the IPS gives the manager discretion either to over- or under-hedge the portfolio, 
relative to the “neutral” benchmark, there is the possibility to add incremental value 
based on the manager’s market view. Profits from successful tactical positioning help 
reduce net hedging costs. For example, if the neutral benchmark hedge ratio is 100% for 
the base currency being hedged, and the portfolio manager has a market opinion that 
the base currency is likely to depreciate, then over-hedging through a short position 
in P/B forward contracts might be implemented—that is, the manager might use a 
hedge ratio higher than 100%. Similarly, if the manager’s market opinion is that the 
base currency is likely to appreciate, the currency exposure might be under -hedged.
A variant of this approach would be to adjust the hedge ratio based on exchange 
rate movements: to increase the hedge ratio if the base currency depreciated, but 
decrease the hedge ratio if the base currency appreciated. Essentially, this approach 
is a form of “delta hedging” that tries to mimic the payoff function of a put option on 
the base currency. That is, this form of dynamic hedging with forward contracts tries 
to increasingly participate in any upside moves of the base currency, but increasingly 
hedge any downside moves. Doing so adds “convexity” to the portfolio, meaning that 
the hedge’s payoff function will be a convex curve when this function is graphed 
with profit on the vertical axis and the spot rate on the horizontal axis. (Note that 
this concept of convexity is identical in intent to the concept of convexity describing 
bonds; as convexity increases the price of a bond rises more quickly in a declining 
yield environment and drops more slowly in a rising yield environment. Convexity is 
a desirable characteristic in both the fixed-income and currency-hedging contexts.)
Protective Put Using OTM Options
In the previous section, we examined a dynamic hedging strategy using forward 
contracts that tries to mimic the payoff function of an option and put convexity into 
the hedge’s payoff function. The payoff functions for options are naturally convex to 
begin with. However, this can be a costly form of convexity (relatively high option 
premiums), and fully hedging a currency position with a protective put strategy using 
an ATM option is the most expensive means of all to buy convexity.
One way to reduce the cost of using options is to accept some downside risk by 
using an OTM option, such as a 25- or 10-delta option. These options will be less 
costly, but also do not fully protect the portfolio from adverse currency movements. 
Conversely, it makes sense to insure against larger risks but accept some smaller

examples.

day-to-day price movements in currencies. As an analogy, it may be possible to buy 
a home or car insurance policy with a zero deductible—but the premiums would be 
exorbitant. It may be more rational to have a cheaper insurance policy and accept 
responsibility for minor events, but insure against extreme damage.
Risk Reversal (or Collar)
Another set of option strategies involves selling  options (also known as writing options) 
to earn income that can be used to offset the cost of buying a put option, which forms 
the “core” of the hedge. Recall that in this section, we are using the simplifying con -
vention that the manager is long the base currency in the P/B quote; hence puts and 
not calls would be used for hedging in this case.
One strategy to obtain downside protection at a lower cost than a straight protective 
put position is to buy an OTM put option and write  an OTM call option. Essentially, 
the portfolio manager is selling some of the upside potential for movements in the 
base currency (writing a call) and using the option’s premiums to help pay the cost of 
the long put option being purchased. This approach is similar to creating a collar in 
fixed-income markets. The portfolio is protected against downside movements, but 
its upside is limited to the strike price on the OTM call option; the exchange rate risk 
is confined to a corridor or “collar. ”
In professional FX markets, having a long position in a call option and a short 
position in a put option is called a risk reversal . For example, buying a 25-delta call 
and writing a 25-delta put is referred to as a long position in a 25-delta risk reversal. 
The position used to create the collar position we just described (buying a put, writing 
a call) would be a short  position in a risk reversal.
The majority of currency hedging for foreign-currency asset portfolios and cor -
porate accounts is based on the use of forward contracts and simple option strategies 
(protective puts/covered calls and risk reversals/collars). We now begin to transition 
to more active trading strategies that are designed to express market views for specu -
lative profit.
Put Spread
A variation of the short risk reversal position is a put spread , which is also used to 
reduce the upfront cost of buying a protective put. The short risk reversal is structured 
by buying a put option and writing a call option: the premiums received by writing the 
call help cover the cost of the put. Similarly, the put spread position involves buying 
a put option and writing another put option to help cover the cost of the long put’s 
premiums. This position is typically structured by buying an OTM put, and writing 
a deeper-OTM put to gain income from premiums; both options involved have the 
same maturity.
To continue our previous example, with the current spot rate at 1.3550, the portfolio 
manager might set up the following put spread: buy a put with a strike of 1.3500 and 
write a put with a strike of 1.3450. The payoff on the put spread position will then be 
as follows: there is no hedge protection between 1.3550 and 1.3500; the portfolio is 
hedged from 1.3500 down to 1.3450; at spot rates below 1.3450, the portfolio becomes 
unhedged again. The put spread reduces the cost of the hedge, but at the cost of more 
limited downside protection. The portfolio manager would then use this spread only 
for cases in which a modest decline in the spot exchange rate was expected, and this 
position would have to be closely monitored against adverse exchange rate movements.
Note that the put spread structure will not be zero-cost because the deeper-OTM 
put (1.3450) being written will be cheaper than the less-OTM put (1.3500) being 
bought. However, there are approaches that will make the put spread (or almost any 
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 190
other option spread position) cheaper or possibly zero-cost: the manager could alter: 
(a) the strike prices of the options; (b) the notional amounts of the options; or (c) 
some combination of these two measures.
Altering the strike prices of the put options would mean moving them closer 
together (and hence more equal in cost). However, this would reduce the downside 
protection on the hedge. Instead, the portfolio manager could write a larger notional 
amount for the deeper-OTM option; for example, the ratio for the notionals for the 
options written versus bought might be 1:2. (In standard FX market notation, this 
would be a 1 × 2 put spread—the option with exercise price closest to being ATM is 
given first. However, to avoid confusion it is good practice to specify explicitly in the 
price quote which is the long and short positions, and what their deltas/strike prices 
are.) Although this structure may now be (approximately) zero-cost it is not without 
risks: for spot rates below 1.3450 the portfolio has now seen its exposure to the base 
currency double-up (because of the 1:2 proportion of notionals) and at a worse spot 
exchange rate for the portfolio on top of it. Creating a zero-cost structure with a 1 × 
2 put spread is equivalent to adding leverage to the options position, because you are 
selling more options than you are buying. This means that this put spread position 
will have to be carefully managed. For example, the portfolio manager might choose to 
close out the short position in the deep-OTM put (by going long/buying an equivalent 
put option) before the base currency depreciates to the 1.3450 strike level. This may 
be a costly position exit, however, as the market moves against the manager’s original 
positioning. Because of this, this sort of 1 × 2 structure may be more appropriate for 
expressing directional opinions rather than as a pure hedging strategy.
Seagull Spread
An alternative, and somewhat safer approach, would be to combine the original put 
spread position (1:1 proportion of notionals) with a covered call position. This is sim -
ply an extension of the concept behind risk reversals and put spreads. The “core” of 
the hedge (for a manager long the base currency) is the long position in a put option. 
This is expensive. To reduce the cost, a short risk reversal position writes a call option 
while a put spread writes a deep-OTM put option. Of course, the manager can always 
do both: that is, be long a protective put and then write both  a call and a deep-OTM 
put. This option structure is sometimes referred to as a seagull spread .
As with the names for other option strategies based on winged creatures, the 
“seagull” indicates an option structure with at least three individual options, and in 
which the options at the most distant strikes—the wings—are on the opposite side 
of the market from the middle strike(s)—the body. For example, if the current spot 
price is 1.3550, a seagull could be constructed by going long an ATM put at 1.3550 
(the middle strike is the “body”), short  an OTM put at 1.3500, and short  an OTM call 
at 1.3600 (the latter two options are the “wings”). Because the options in the “wings” 
are being written (sold) this is called a short  seagull position. The risk/return profile 
of this structure gives full downside protection from 1.3550 to 1.3500 (at which point 
the short put position neutralizes the hedge) and participation in the upside potential 
in spot rate movements to 1.3600 (the strike level for the short call option).
Note that because two options are now being written to gain premiums instead of 
one, this approach allows the strike price of the long put position to be ATM, increasing 
the downside protection. The various strikes and/or notional sizes of these options 
(and hence their premiums) can always be adjusted up or down until a zero-cost 
structure is obtained. However, note that this particular seagull structure gives away 
some upside potential (the short call position) as well as takes on some downside risk 
(if the short put position is triggered, it will disable the hedge coverage coming from 
the long put position). As always, lower structure costs come with some combination 
of lower downside protection and/or less upside potential.
Currency Management Strategies 191
There are many variants of these seagull strategies, each of which provides a different 
risk–reward profile (and net cost). For example, for the portfolio manager wishing to 
hedge a long position in the base currency in the P/B quote when the current spot rate 
is 1.3550, another seagull structure would be to write an ATM call at 1.3550 and use 
the proceeds to buy an OTM put option at 1.3500 and an OTM call option at 1.3600. 
Note that in this seagull structure, the “body” is now a short  option position, not a long 
position as in the previous example, and the “wings” are the long position. Hence, it is 
a long seagull spread. This option structure provides cheap downside protection (the 
hedge kicks in at the put’s 1.3500 strike) while providing the portfolio manager with 
unlimited participation in any rally in the base currency beyond the 1.3600 strike of 
the OTM call option. As before, the various option strikes and/or notional sizes on the 
options bought and written can be adjusted so that a zero-cost structure is obtained.
Exotic Options
In this section, we move even further away from derivatives and trading strategies 
used mainly for hedging, and toward the more speculative end of the risk spectrum 
dominated by active currency management. Exotic options are often used by more 
sophisticated players in the professional trading market—for example, currency overlay 
managers—and are less frequently used by institutional investors, investment funds, 
or corporations for hedging purposes. There are several reasons for this relatively light 
usage of “exotics” for hedging purposes, some related to the fact that many smaller 
entities lack familiarity with these products. Another reason involves the difficulty of 
getting hedge accounting treatment in many jurisdictions, which is more advantageous 
for financial reporting reasons. Finally, the specialized terms of such instruments make 
them difficult to value for regulatory and accounting purposes.
In general, the term “exotic” refers to all options that are not “vanilla. ” In FX, 
vanilla refers essentially to European-style put and call options. The full range of exotic 
options is both very broad and constantly evolving; many are extraordinarily complex 
both to price and even to understand. However, all exotics, no matter how complex, 
typically share one defining feature in common: They are designed to customize the 
risk exposures desired by the client and provide them at the lowest possible price.19 
Much like the trading strategies described previously, they usually involve some com -
bination of lower downside protection and/or lower upside potential while providing 
the client with the specific risk exposures they are prepared to manage, and to do so 
at what is generally a lower cost than vanilla options.
The two most common type of exotic options encountered in foreign exchange 
markets are those with knock-in/knock-out  features and digital options.
An option with a knock-in feature is essentially a vanilla option that is created only 
when the spot exchange rate touches a pre-specified level (this trigger level, called the 
“barrier, ” is not the same as the strike price). Similarly a knock-out option is a vanilla 
option that ceases to exist when the spot exchange rate touches some pre-specified 
barrier level. Because these options only exist (i.e., get knocked-in or knocked-out) 
under certain circumstances, they are more restrictive than vanilla options and hence 
are cheaper. But again, the knock-in/out features provide less upside potential and/
or downside protection.
Digital options are also called binary options, or all-or-nothing options. The expiry 
value of an in-the-money vanilla option varies based on the amount of difference 
between the expiry level and strike price. In contrast, digital options pay out a fixed 
amount if they are determined to be in-the-money. For example, American digital 
options pay a fixed  amount if they “touch” their exercise level at any time before 
19 Although the price is low for the client compared with vanilla options, exotics are typically nonetheless 
high profit margin items for investment dealers.
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 192
expiry (even if by a single pip). This characteristic of “extreme payoff” options makes 
them almost akin to a lottery ticket. Because of these large payoffs, digital options 
usually cost more than vanilla options with the same strike price. But digitals also 
provide highly leveraged exposure to movements in the spot rate. This makes these 
exotic products more appropriate as trading tools for active currency management, 
rather than as hedging tools. In practice, digital options are typically used by more 
sophisticated speculative accounts in the FX market to express directional views on 
exchange rates.
A full exposition of exotic options is beyond the scope of this reading, but the 
reader should be aware of their existence and why they exist.
Section Summary
Clearly, loosening the constraint of a fully hedged portfolio begins to introduce com -
plicated active currency management decisions. The following steps can be helpful 
to sort things out:
a. First, identify the base  currency in the P/B quote (currency pair) you are 
dealing with. Derivatives are typically quoted in terms of either buying or 
selling the base  currency when the option is exercised. A move upward in 
the P/B quote is an appreciation of the base currency.
b. Then, identify whether the base currency must be bought  or sold to establish 
the hedge. These are the price movements you will be protecting against.
c. If buying  the base currency is required to implement the hedge, then the 
core hedge structure will be based on some combination of a long call 
option and/or a long forward contract. The cost of this core hedge can be 
reduced by buying an OTM call option or writing options to earn premi -
ums. (But keep in mind, lower hedging costs equate to less downside pro -
tection and/or upside potential.)
d. If selling  the base currency is required to implement the hedge, then the 
core hedge structure will be based on some combination of a long put 
option and/or a short forward contract. The cost of this core hedge can 
be reduced by buying an OTM put option or writing options to earn 
premiums.
e. The higher the allowed discretion for active management, the lower the 
risk aversion; and the firmer a particular market view is held, the more the 
hedge is likely to be structured to allow risk exposures in the portfolio. This 
approach involves positioning in derivatives that “lean the same way” as 
the market view. (For example, a market view that the base currency will 
depreciate would use some combination of short forward contracts, writing 
call options, buying put options, and using “bearish” exotic strategies.) This 
directional bias to the trading position would be superimposed on the core 
hedge position described in steps “c” and “d, ” creating an active-trading “tilt” 
in the portfolio.
f. For these active strategies, varying the strike prices and notional amounts 
of the options involved can move the trading position toward a zero-cost 
structure. But as with hedges, keep in mind that lower cost implies less 
downside protection and/or upside potential for the portfolio.
Currency Management Strategies 193
A lot of different hedging tools and strategies have been named and covered in 
this section. Rather than attempting to absorb all of them by rote memorization (a 
put spread is “X” and a seagull is “Y”), the reader is encouraged instead to focus on 
the intuition behind a hedge, and how and why it is constructed. It matters less what 
name (if any) is given to any specific approach; what is important is understanding 
how all the moving parts fit together. The reader should focus on a “building blocks” 
approach in understanding how and why the parts of the currency hedge are assem -
bled in a given manner.
EXAMPLE 6
Alternative Hedging Strategies
Brixworth & St. Ives Asset Management, the UK-based investment firm, has 
hedged the exposure of its Aggressive Growth Fund to the MXN with a long 
position in a MXN/GBP forward contract. The fund’s foreign-currency asset 
exposure to the ZAR is hedged by buying an ATM call option on the ZAR/GBP 
currency pair. The portfolio managers at Brixworth & St. Ives are looking at ways 
to modify the risk–reward trade-offs and net costs of their currency hedges.
Jasmine Khan, one of the analysts at Brixworth & St. Ives, proposes an 
option-based hedge structure for the long-ZAR exposure that would replace 
the hedge based on the ATM call option with either long or short positions in 
the following three options on ZAR/GBP:
a. ATM put option
b. 25-delta put option
c. 25-delta call option
Khan argues that these three options can be combined into a hedge structure 
that will have some limited downside risk, but provide complete hedge protection 
starting at the relevant 25-delta strike level. The structure will also have upside 
potential, although this will not start until the ZAR/GBP exchange rate moves 
to the relevant 25-delta strike level. Finally, this structure can be created at a 
relatively low cost because it involves option writing.
1. The best method for Brixworth & St. Ives to gain some upside potential for 
the hedge on the Aggressive Growth Fund’s MXN exposure using MXN/
GBP options is to replace the forward contract with a:
A. long position in an OTM put.
B. short position in an ATM call.
C. long position in a 25-delta risk reversal.
Solution to 1:
C is correct. The Aggressive Growth Fund has a long foreign-currency expo -
sure to the MXN in its asset portfolio, which is hedged by selling the MXN 
against the GBP , or equivalently, buying the GBP—the base currency in the 
P/B quote—against the MXN. This need to protect against an appreciation  
in the GBP is why the hedge is using a long position in the forward contract. 
To set a collar around the MXN/GBP rate, Brixworth & St. Ives would want 
a long call option position with a strike greater than the current spot rate 
(this gives upside potential to the hedge) and a short put position with a 
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 194
strike less than the current spot rate (this reduces net cost of the hedge). A 
long call and a short put defines a long position in a risk reversal.
Choice A is incorrect because, if exercised, buying a put option would 
increase the fund’s exposure to the MXN (sell GBP , buy MXN). Similar -
ly, Choice B is incorrect because, if exercised, the ATM call option would 
increase the MXN exposure (the GBP is “called” away from the fund at the 
strike price with MXN delivered). Moreover, although writing the ATM call 
option would gain some income from premiums, writing options (on their 
own) is never considered the “best” hedge because the premium income 
earned is fixed but the potential losses on adverse currency moves are po -
tentially unlimited.
2. While keeping the ATM call option in the ZAR/GBP , the method that would 
lead to greatest  cost reduction on the hedge would be to:
A. buy a 25-delta put.
B. write a 10-delta call.
C. write a 25-delta call.
Solution to 2:
C is correct. As before, the hedge is implemented in protecting against an 
appreciation  of the base currency of the P/B quote, the GBP . The hedge is 
established with an ATM call option (a long position in the GBP). Writing 
an OTM call option (i.e., with a strike that is more than the current spot 
rate of 20.1050) establishes a call spread (although hedge protection is lost if 
ZAR/GBP expires at or above the strike level). Writing a 25-delta call earns 
more income from premiums than a deeper-OTM 10-delta call (although 
the 25-delta call has less hedge protection). Buying an option would increase 
the cost of the hedge, and a put option on the ZAR/GBP would increase the 
fund’s ZAR exposure if exercised (the GBP is “put” to the counterparty at 
the strike price and ZAR received).
3. Setting up Khan’s proposed hedge structure would most likely  involve being:
A. long the 25-delta options and short the ATM option.
B. long the 25-delta call, and short both the ATM and 25-delta put 
options.
C. short the 25-delta call, and long both the ATM and 25-delta put 
options.
Solution to 3:
A is correct. Once again, the hedge is based on hedging the need to sell 
ZAR/buy GBP , and GBP is the base currency in the ZAR/GBP quote. This 
means the hedge needs to protect against an appreciation  of the GBP (an 
appreciation of the ZAR/GBP rate). Based on Khan’s description, the hedge 
provides protection after a certain loss point, which would be a long 25-del -
ta call. Upside potential after favorable (i.e., down) moves in the ZAR/GBP 
past a certain level means a long 25-delta put. Getting the low net cost that 
Khan refers to means that the cost of these two long positions is financed 
by selling the ATM option. (Together these three positions define a long 
seagull spread). Choice B is incorrect because although the first two legs of 
the position are right, a short position in the put does not provide upside 
potential (from a down-move in ZAR/GBP). Choice C is incorrect because 
any option-based hedge, given the need to hedge against an up-move in 
Hedging Multiple Foreign Currencies 195
the ZAR/GBP rate, is going to be based on a long call position. C does not 
contain any of these.
HEDGING MULTIPLE FOREIGN CURRENCIES
describe the use of cross-hedges, macro-hedges, and 
minimum-variance-hedge ratios in portfolios exposed to multiple 
foreign currencies
We now expand our discussion to hedging a portfolio with multiple foreign-currency 
assets. The hedging tools and strategies are very similar to those discussed for hedging 
a single foreign-currency asset, except now the currency hedge must consider the 
correlation  between the various foreign-currency risk exposures.
For example, consider the case of a US-domiciled investor who has exposures 
to foreign-currency assets in Australia and New Zealand. These two economies are 
roughly similar in that they are resource-based and closely tied to the regional econ -
omy of the Western Pacific, especially the large emerging markets in Asia. As a result, 
the movements in their currencies are often closely correlated; the USD/AUD and 
USD/NZD currency pairs will tend to move together. If the portfolio manager has the 
discretion to take short positions, the portfolio may (for example) possibly have a net 
long position in the Australian foreign-currency asset and a net short position in the 
New Zealand foreign-currency asset. In this case, there may be less need to hedge 
away the AUD and NZD currency exposures separately because the portfolio’s long 
exposure to the AUD is diversified by the short position on the NZD.
Cross Hedges and Macro Hedges
A cross hedge  occurs when a position in one asset (or a derivative based on the asset) 
is used to hedge the risk exposures of a different asset (or a derivative based on it). 
Normally, cross hedges are not needed because, as we mentioned earlier, forward 
contracts and other derivatives are widely available in almost every conceivable cur -
rency pair. However, if the portfolio already has “natural” cross hedges in the form of 
negatively correlated residual currency exposures—as in the long-AUD/short-NZD 
example in Section 11—this helps moderate portfolio risk (σ[ RDC]) without having 
to use a direct hedge on the currency exposure.
Sometimes a distinction is made between a “proxy” hedge and a “cross” hedge. 
When this distinction is made, a proxy hed ge removes the foreign currency risk by 
hedging it back to the investor’s domestic currency—such as in the example with 
USD/AUD and USD/NZD discussed in the text. In contrast, a cross hed ge moves 
the currency risk from one foreign currency to another foreign currency. For exam -
ple, a US-domiciled investor may have an exposure to both the Indonesian rupiah 
(IDR) and the Thai baht (THB), but based on a certain market view, may only want 
exposure to the THB. In this context, the manager might use currency derivatives as 
a cross hedge to convert the IDR/USD exposure to a THB/USD exposure. But not 
all market participants make this sharp of a distinction between proxy hedges and 
cross hedges, and these terms are often used interchangeably. The most common 
term found among practitioners in most asset classes is simply a cross hedge, as we 
are using the term here: hedging an exposure with a closely correlated product (i.e., 
a proxy hedge when this distinction is made). The cross hedge of moving currency 11
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 196
exposures between various foreign  currencies is more of a special-case application 
of this concept. In our example, a US investor wanting to shift currency exposures 
between the IDR and THB would only need to shift the relative size of the IDR/USD 
and THB/USD forward contracts already  being used. As mentioned earlier, forwards 
are available on almost every currency pair, so a cross hedge from foreign currency 
“ A” to foreign currency “B” would be a special case when derivatives on one of the 
currencies are not available.
EXAMPLE 7
Cross Hedges
Mai Nguyen works at Cape Henlopen Advisors, which runs a US-domiciled 
fund that invests in foreign-currency assets of Australia and New Zealand. The 
fund currently has equally weighted exposure to one-year Australian and New 
Zealand treasury bills (i.e., both of the portfolio weights, ωi = 0.5). Because the 
foreign-currency return on these treasury bill assets is risk-free and known in 
advance, their expected σ( RFC) is equal to zero.
Nguyen wants to calculate the USD-denominated returns on this portfolio 
as well as the cross hedging effects of these investments. She collects the fol -
lowing information:
 
Expected Values Australia New Zealand
Foreign-currency asset return RFC 4.0% 6.0%
Foreign-currency return RFX 5.0% 5.0%
Asset risk σ( RFC) 0% 0%
Currency risk σ( RFX) 8.0% 10.0%
Correlation (USD/AUD; USD/NZD) +0.85
 
Using Equation 1 , Nguyen calculates that the expected domestic-currency return 
for the Australian asset is
     (  1.04 )       (  1.05 )     − 1 = 0.092  
or 9.2%. Likewise, she determines that the expected domestic-currency return 
for the New Zealand asset is
     (  1.06 )       (  1.05 )     − 1 = 0.113  
or 11.3%. Together, the result is that the expected domestic-currency return 
(RDC) on the equally weighted foreign-currency asset portfolio is the weighted 
average of these two individual country returns, or
 RDC = 0.5(9.2%) + 0.5(11.3%) = 10.3%
Nguyen now turns her attention to calculating the portfolio’s investment risk 
[σ(RDC)]. To calculate the expected risk for the domestic-currency return, the 
currency risk of RFX needs to be multiplied by the known  return on the treasury 
bills. The portfolio’s investment risk, σ( RDC), is found by calculating the standard 
deviation of the right-hand-side of:
 RDC = (1 + RFC)(1 + RFX) − 1  
Although RFX is a random variable—it is not known in advance—the RFC term 
is in fact known in advance because the asset return is risk-free. Because of this 
Nguyen can make use of the statistical rules that, first, σ( kX) = kσ(X), where X is 
a random variable and k is a constant; and second, that the correlation between 
Hedging Multiple Foreign Currencies 197
a random variable and a constant is zero. These results greatly simplify the 
calculations because, in this case, she does not need to consider the correlation 
between exchange rate movements and foreign-currency asset returns. Instead, 
Nguyen needs to calculate the risk only on the currency side. Applying these 
statistical rules to the above formula leads to the following results:
A. The expected risk (i.e., standard deviation) of the domestic-currency 
return for the Australian asset is equal to (1.04) × 8% = 8.3%.
B. The expected risk (i.e., standard deviation) of the domestic-currency 
return for the New Zealand asset is equal to (1.06) × 10% = 10.6%.
Adding all of these numerical values into Equation 4  leads Nguyen to calculate:
σ2(RDC) = (0.5)2(8.3%)2 + (0.5)2(10.6%)2 + [(2)0.5(8.3%)0.5(10.6%)0.85]
 = 0.8%
The standard deviation of this amount—that is, σ( RDC)—is 9.1%. Note that in 
the expression, all of the units are in percent, so for example, 8.3% is equivalent 
to 0.083 for calculation purposes. The careful reader may also note that Nguyen 
is able to use an exact expression for calculating the variance of the portfolio 
returns, rather than the approximate expressions shown in Equations 3  and 5. 
This is because, with risk-free foreign-currency assets, the variance of these 
foreign-currency returns σ2(RFC) is equal to zero.
Nguyen now considers an alternative scenario in which, instead of an equally 
weighted portfolio (where the ωi = 0.5), the fund has a long exposure to the New 
Zealand asset and a short exposure to the Australian asset (i.e., the ωi are +1 
and −1, respectively; this is similar to a highly leveraged carry trade position). 
Putting these weights into Equations 2  and 4 leads to
 RDC = −1.0(9.2%) + 1.0(11.3%) = 2.1%
σ2(RDC) = (1.0)2(8.3%)2 + (1.0)2(10.6%)2 + [−2.0(8.3%)(10.6%)0.85]
 = 0.3%
The standard deviation—that is, σ( RDC)—is now 5.6%, less than either of 
the expected risks for foreign-currency asset returns (results A and B). Nguyen 
concludes that having long and short positions in positively correlated currencies 
can lead to much lower portfolio risk, through the benefits of cross hedging. 
(Nguyen goes on to calculate that if the expected correlation between USD/AUD 
and USD/NZD increases to 0.95, with all else equal, the expected domestic-cur -
rency return risk on the long–short portfolio drops to 3.8%.)
Some types of cross hedges are often referred to as macro hedges. The reason is 
because the hedge is more focused on the entire portfolio, particularly when individ -
ual asset price movements are highly correlated, rather than on individual assets or 
currency pairs. Another way of viewing a macro hedge is to see the portfolio not just 
as a collection of financial assets, but as a collection of risk exposures. These various 
risk exposures are typically defined in categories, such as term risk, credit risk, and 
liquidity risk. These risks can also be defined in terms of the potential financial scenar -
ios the portfolio is exposed to, such as recession, financial sector stress, or inflation. 
Often macro hedges are defined in terms of the financial scenario they are designed 
to protect the portfolio from.
Putting gold in the portfolio sometimes serves this purpose by helping to provide 
broad portfolio protection against extreme market events. Using a volatility overlay 
program can also hedge the portfolio against such risks because financial stress is 
typically associated with a spike in exchange rates’ implied volatility. Using a derivative 
product based on an index, rather than specific assets or currencies, can also define a 
macro hedge. One macro hedge specific to foreign exchange markets uses derivatives 
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 198
based on fixed-weight baskets of currencies (such derivatives are available in both 
exchange-traded and OTC form). In a multi-currency portfolio, it may not always be 
cost efficient to hedge each single currency separately, and in these situations a macro 
hedge using currency basket derivatives is an alternative approach.
Minimum-Variance Hedge Ratio
A mathematical approach to determining the optimal cross hedging ratio is known as 
the minimum-variance hedge ratio . Recall that regression analysis based on ordinary 
least squares (OLS) is used to minimize the variance of    ˆ ε   , the residual between actual 
and fitted values of the regression
   y  t   = α + β  x  t   +  ε  t    where      ˆ ε    t   =  y  t   −    (    ˆ α   +   ˆ β    x  t   )     
This same principle can be used to minimize the tracking error between the value 
of the hedged asset and the hedging instrument. In the regression formula, we sub -
stitute the percentage change in the value of the asset to be hedged for yt, and the 
percentage change in value of the hedging instrument for xt (both of these values are 
measured in terms of the investor’s domestic currency). The calculated coefficient 
in this regression (   ˆ β   ) gives the optimal hedging ratio, which means it minimizes the 
variance of    ˆ ε    and minimizes the tracking error between changes in the value of the 
hedge and changes in the value of the asset it is hedging. It can be shown that the 
formula for the minimum-variance hedge ratio—the formula for calculating the    ˆ β    
coefficient in the regression—is mathematically equal to:
    covariance    (  y, x )      ____________   variance    (  x )       = correlation    (  y, x )     ×    [    std. dev .    (  y )     _ std. dev .    (  x )       ]     
where y and x are defined as before, the change in the domestic-currency value of the 
asset and the hedge, respectively.
Calculating the minimum-variance hedge ratio typically applies only for “indirect” 
hedges based on cross hedging or macro hedges; it is not typically applied to a “direct” 
hedge in which exposure to a spot rate is hedged with a forward contract in that 
same currency pair. This is because the correlation between movements in the spot 
rate and its forward contract is likely to be very close to +1. Likewise, the variance in 
spot price movements and movements in the price of the forward contract are also 
likely to be approximately equal. Therefore, calculating the minimum-variance hedge 
ratio by regressing changes in the spot exchange rate against changes in the forward 
rate will almost always result is a    ˆ β    regression estimate very close to 1, and hence a 
minimum-variance hedge ratio close to 100%. So, undertaking the regression analysis 
is superfluous.
But the minimum-variance hedge ratio can be quite different from 100% when 
the hedge is jointly  optimized over both  exchange rate movements RFX and changes 
in the foreign-currency value of the asset RFC. A sidebar discusses this case.
There can also be cases when the optimal hedge ratio may not be 100% because 
of the market characteristics of a specific currency pair. For example, a currency pair 
may not have a (liquid) forward contract available and hence an alternative cross 
hedging instrument or a macro hedge must be used instead. We examine when such 
situations might come up in Section 13.
Basis Risk
The portfolio manager must be aware that any time a direct currency hedge (i.e., a spot 
rate hedged against its own forward contract) is replaced with an indirect hedge (cross 
hedge, macro hedge), basis risk  is brought into the portfolio. This risk reflects the 
fact that the price movements in the exposure being hedged and the price movements 
Hedging Multiple Foreign Currencies 199
in the cross hedge instrument are not perfectly correlated, and that the correlation 
will change with time—and sometimes both dramatically and unexpectedly. For a 
minimum-variance hedge ratio, this risk is expressed as instability in the    ˆ β    coefficient 
estimate as more data become available.
For an example of basis risk, return to the illustration earlier of the foreign-currency 
asset portfolio that cross hedged a long USD/AUD exposure with a short USD/
NZD exposure. It is not only possible, but highly likely, that the correlation between 
movements in the USD/AUD and the USD/NZD spot rates will vary with time. This 
varying correlation would reflect movements in the NZD/AUD spot rate. Another 
example of basis risk would be that the correlation between a multi-currency port -
folio’s domestic-currency market value and the value of currency basket derivatives 
being used as a macro hedge will neither be perfect nor constant.
At a minimum, this means that all cross hedges and macro hedges will have to be 
carefully monitored and, as needed, rebalanced to account for the drift in correlations. 
It also means that minimum-variance hedge ratios will have to be re-estimated as more 
data become available. The portfolio manager should beware that sudden, unexpected 
spikes in basis risk can sometimes turn what was once a minimum-variance hedge or 
an effective cross hedge into a position that is highly correlated with the underlying 
assets being hedged—the opposite of a hedge.
Basis risk is also used in the context of forward and futures contracts because the 
price movements of these derivatives products do not always correspond exactly with 
those of the underlying currency. This is because the price of the forward contract 
also reflects the interest rate differential between the two countries in the currency 
pair as well as the term to contract maturity. But with futures and forwards, the deriv -
atives price converges to the price of the underlying as maturity approaches, which 
is enforced by arbitrage. This convergence is not the case with cross hedges, which 
potentially can go disastrously wrong with sudden movements in market risk (price 
correlations), credit risk, or liquidity risk.
OPTIMAL MINIMUM-VARIANCE HEDGES
For simple foreign-currency asset portfolios, it may be possible to use the sin -
gle-variable OLS regression technique to do a joint  optimization of the hedge 
over both the foreign-currency value of the asset RFC and the foreign-currency 
risk exposure RFX. This approach will reduce the variance of the all-in domes -
tic-currency return RDC, which is the risk that matters most to the investor, not 
just reducing the variance of the foreign exchange risk RFX.
Calculating the minimum-variance hedge for the foreign exchange risk RFX 
proceeds by regressing changes in the spot rate against changes in the value of 
the hedging instrument (i.e., the forward contract). But as indicated in the text, 
performing this regression is typically unnecessary; for all intents and purposes, 
the minimum-variance hedge for a spot exchange rate using a forward contract 
will be close to 100%.
But when there is only a single  foreign-currency asset involved, one can per -
form a joint optimization over both of the foreign-currency risks (i.e., both RFC 
and RFX) by regressing changes in the domestic-currency return ( RDC) against 
percentage changes in the value of the hedging instrument. Basing the optimal 
hedge ratio on the OLS estimate for β in this regression will minimize the vari -
ance of the domestic-currency return σ2(RDC). The result will be a better hedge 
ratio than just basing the regression on RFX alone because this joint approach 
will also pick up any correlations  between RFX and RFC. (Recall from Section 4 
that the asset mix in the portfolio, and hence the correlations between RFX and 
RFC, can affect the optimal hedge ratio.) This single-variable OLS approach, 
however, will only work if there is a single foreign-currency asset in the portfolio.
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 200
Work by Campbell (2010)  has shown that the optimal hedge ratio based 
jointly on movements in RFC and RFX for international bond  portfolios is almost 
always close to 100%. However, the optimal hedge ratio for single-country foreign 
equity  portfolios varies widely between currencies, and will depend on both  
the investor’s domestic currency and the currency of the foreign investment. 
For example, the optimal hedge ratio for a US equity portfolio will be different 
for UK and eurozone-based investors; and for eurozone investors, the optimal 
hedge ratio for a US equity portfolio can be different from that of a Canadian 
equity portfolio. The study found that the optimal hedge ratio for foreign equity 
exposures can vary widely from 100% between countries. But as the author 
cautions, these optimal hedge ratios are calculated on historical data that may 
not be representative of future price dynamics.
Minimum-Variance Hedge Ratio Example
Annie McYelland is an analyst at Scotland- based Kilmarnock Capital. Her firm 
is considering an investment in an equity index fund based on the Swiss Stock 
Market Index (SMI). The SMI is a market-cap weighted average of the twenty 
largest and most liquid Swiss companies, and captures about 85% of the overall 
market capitalization of the Swiss equity market.
McYelland is asked to formulate a currency-hedging strategy. Because this 
investment involves only one currency pair and one investment (the SMI), she 
decides to calculate the minimum-variance hedge ratio for the entire risk expo -
sure, not just the currency exposure. McYelland collects 10 years of monthly data 
on the CHF/GBP spot exchange rate and movements in the Swiss Market Index.
McYelland notes that the GBP is the base currency in the CHF/GBP quote 
and that the formula for domestic-currency returns ( RDC) shown in Equation 
1 requires that the domestic currency be the price currency. Accordingly, she 
starts by inverting the CHF/GBP quote to a GBP/CHF quote ( SGBP /CHF). Then 
she calculates the monthly percentage changes for this adjusted currency series 
(%ΔSGBP/CHF ) as well as for the SMI (%ΔSMI). This allows her to calculate the 
monthly returns of an unhedged investment in the SMI with these unhedged 
returns measured in the “domestic” currency, the GBP:
 RDC = (1 + RFC)(1 + RFX) − 1 
where RFC = %ΔSMI and RFX = %Δ SGBP/CHF . Because McYelland wants to 
minimize the variance of these unhedged domestic-currency returns, she cal -
culates the minimum-variance hedge ratio with the following OLS regression:
 RDC = α + β(%Δ SGBP/CHF ) + ε
The calculated regression coefficients show that    ˆ α    = −0.21 and    ˆ β    = 1.35. 
McYelland interprets these results to mean that the estimated    ˆ β   -coefficient 
is the minimum-variance hedge ratio. This conclusion makes sense because    ˆ β    
represents the sensitivity of the domestic-currency return on the portfolio to 
percentage changes in the spot rate. In this case, the return on the SMI seems 
very sensitive to the appreciation of the CHF. Indeed, over the 10 years of data 
she collected, McYelland notices that the correlation between %ΔSMI and 
%ΔSGBP/CHF  is equal to +0.6.
On the basis of these calculations, she recommends that the minimum-vari -
ance hedge ratio for Kilmarnock Capital’s exposure to the SMI be set at approx -
imately 135%. This recommendation means that a long CHF1,000,000 exposure 
to the SMI should be hedged with a short  position in CHF against the GBP of 
approximately CHF1,350,000. Because forward contracts in professional FX 
Currency Management Tools and Strategies: A Summary 201
markets are quoted in terms of CHF/GBP for this currency pair, this would 
mean a long position in the forward contract ( FCHF /GBP)—that is, selling  the 
CHF means buying  the base currency GBP .
McYelland cautions the Investment Committee at Kilmarnock Capital that 
this minimum-variance hedge ratio is only approximate and must be closely 
monitored because it is estimated over historical data that may not be repre -
sentative of future price dynamics. For example, the +0.6 correlation estimated 
between %ΔSMI and %Δ SGBP/CHF  is the 10-year average  correlation; future 
market conditions may not correspond to this historical average.
CURRENCY MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND STRATEGIES: 
A SUMMARY
describe how forward contracts and FX (foreign exchange) swaps are 
used to adjust hedge ratios
describe trading strategies used to reduce hedging costs and modify 
the risk–return characteristics of a foreign-currency portfolio
describe the use of cross-hedges, macro-hedges, and 
minimum-variance-hedge ratios in portfolios exposed to multiple 
foreign currencies
This section has covered only some of the most common currency management tools 
and strategies used in FX markets—there are a great many other derivatives products 
and strategies that have not been covered. The key points are that there are many  dif-
ferent hedging and active trading strategies, there are many possible variations  within 
each of these strategies, and these strategies can be used in combination  with each 
other. There is no need to cover all of what would be a very large number of possible 
permutations and combinations. Instead, we will close this section with a key thought: 
Each of these many approaches to either hedging or expressing a directional view on 
currency movements has its advantages and disadvantages, its risks, and its costs.
As a result, there is no single “correct” approach to initiating and managing cur -
rency exposures. Instead, at the strategic level, the IPS of the portfolio sets guidelines 
for risk exposures, permissible hedging tools, and strategies, which will vary among 
investors. At the tactical level, at which the portfolio manager has discretion on risk 
exposures, currency strategy will depend on the manager’s management style, market 
view, and risk tolerance. It will also depend on the manager’s perceptions of the relative 
costs and benefit of any given strategy. Market conditions will affect the cost/benefit 
calculations behind the hedging decision, as movements in forward points (expected 
roll yield) or exchange rate volatility (option premiums) affect the expected cost of 
the hedge; the same hedge structure can be “rich” or “cheap” depending on current 
market conditions.
Reflecting all of these considerations, different managers will likely make different 
decisions when confronted with the same opportunity set; and each manager will 
likely have a good reason for their individual decision. The most important point is 
that the portfolio manager be aware of all the benefits, costs, and risks of the chosen 
strategy and be comfortable that any remaining residual currency risks in the hedge 
are acceptable.12
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 202
To summarize the key insights of Sections 9–12—and continuing our example 
of a portfolio manager who is long the base currency in the P/B quote and wants to 
hedge that price risk—the manager needs to understand the following:
1. Because the portfolio has a long exposure to base currency, to neutralize this 
risk the hedge will attempt to build a short  exposure out of that currency’s 
derivatives using some combination of forward and/or option contracts.
2. A currency hedge is not a free good, particularly a complete hedge. The 
hedge cost, real or implied, will consist of some combination of lost upside 
potential, potentially negative roll yield (forward points at a discount or time 
decay on long option positions), and upfront payments of option premiums.
3. The cost of any given hedge structure will vary depending on market condi -
tions (i.e., forward points and implied volatility).
4. The cost of the hedge is focused on its “core. ” For a manager with a long 
exposure to a currency, the cost of this “core” hedge will be the implicit 
costs of a short position in a forward contract (no upside potential, possi -
ble negative roll yield) or the upfront premium on a long position in a put 
option. Either of these two forms of insurance can be expensive. However, 
there are various cost mitigation methods that can be used alone or in com -
bination to reduce these core hedging costs:
a. Writing options to gain upfront premiums.
b. Varying the strike prices of the options written or bought.
c. Varying the notional amounts of the derivative contracts.
d. Using various “exotic” features, such as knock-ins or knock-outs.
5. There is nothing inherently wrong with any of these cost mitigation 
approaches—but the manager must  understand that these invariably involve 
some combination of reduced upside potential and/or reduced downside 
protection. A reduced cost (or even a zero-cost) hedge structure is perfectly 
acceptable, but only as long as the portfolio manager fully understands all 
of the residual risks in the hedge structure and is prepared to accept and 
manage them.
6. There are often “natural” hedges within the portfolio, in which some residual 
risk exposures are uncorrelated with each other and offer portfolio diver -
sification effects. Cross hedges and macro hedges bring basis risk into the 
portfolio, which will have to be monitored and managed.
7. There is no single or “best” way to hedge currency risk. The portfolio man -
ager will have to perform a due diligence examination of potential hedge 
structures and make a rational decision on a cost/benefit basis.
EXAMPLE 8
Hedging Strategies
Ireland-based Old Galway Capital runs several investment trusts for its clients. 
Fiona Doyle has just finished rebalancing the dynamic currency hedge for 
Overseas Investment Trust III, which has an IPS mandate to be fully hedged 
using forward contracts. Shortly after the rebalancing, Old Galway receives 
notice that one of its largest investors in the Overseas Investment Trust III has 
served notice of a large withdrawal from the fund.
Currency Management Tools and Strategies: A Summary 203
Padma Bhattathiri works at Malabar Coast Capital, an India-based invest -
ment company. Her mandate is to seek out any alpha opportunities in global 
FX markets and aggressively manage these for speculative profit. The Reserve 
Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is New Zealand’s central bank, and is scheduled 
to announce its policy rate decision within the week. The consensus forecast 
among economists is that the RBNZ will leave rates unchanged, but Bhattathiri 
believes that the RBNZ will surprise the markets with a rate hike.
Jasmine Khan, analyst at UK-based Brixworth & St. Ives Asset Management, 
has been instructed by the management team to reduce hedging costs for the 
firm’s Aggressive Growth Fund, and that more currency exposure—both downside 
risk and upside potential—will have to be accepted and managed. Currently, the 
fund’s ZAR-denominated foreign-currency asset exposures are being hedged 
with a 25-delta risk reversal (on the ZAR/GBP cross rate). The current ZAR/
GBP spot rate is 20.1350.
Bao Zhang is a market analyst at South Korea–based Kwangju Capital, an 
investment firm that offers several actively managed investment trusts for its 
clients. She notices that the exchange rate for the Philippines Peso (PHP/USD) 
is increasing (PHP is depreciating) toward its 200-day moving average located 
in the 50.2500 area (the current spot rate is 50.2475). She mentions this to 
Akiko Takahashi, a portfolio manager for one of the firm’s investment vehicles. 
Takahashi’s view, based on studying economic fundamentals, is that the PHP/
USD rate should continue to increase, but after speaking with Zhang she is less 
sure. After further conversation, Zhang and Takahashi come to the view that the 
PHP/USD spot rate will either break through the 50.2500 level and gain upward 
momentum through the 50.2600 level, or stall at the 50.2500 level and then drop 
down through the 50.2400 level as frustrated long positions exit the market. They 
decide that either scenario has equal probability over the next month.
Annie McYelland is an analyst at Scotland-based Kilmarnock Capital. The 
firm is considering a USD10,000,000 investment in an S&P 500 Index fund. 
McYelland is asked to calculate the minimum-variance hedge ratio. She collects 
the following statistics based on 10 years of monthly data:
 
σ(%ΔSGBP/USD ) σ(RDC) ρ(RDC;%ΔSGBP/USD )
2.7% 4.4% 0.2
 
Source:  Data are from Bloomberg.
1. Given the sudden liquidity need announced, Doyle’s best course of action 
with regard to the currency hedge is to:
A. do nothing.
B. reduce the hedge ratio.
C. over-hedge by using currency options.
Solution to 1:
A is correct. After rebalancing, the Overseas Investment Trust III is fully 
hedged; currency risk is at a minimum, which is desirable if liquidity needs 
have increased. Choices B and C are incorrect because they increase the 
currency risk exposures.
2. Given her market view, Bhattathiri would most likely  choose which of the 
following long positions?
A. 5-delta put option on NZD/AUD
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 204
B. 10-delta put option on USD/NZD
C. Put spread on JPY/NZD using 10-delta and 25-delta options
Solution to 2:
A is correct. The surprise rate hike should cause the NZD to appreciate 
against most currencies. This appreciation would mean a depreciation of 
the NZD/AUD rate, which a put option can profit from. A 5-delta option 
is deep-OTM, but the price reaction on the option premiums will be more 
extreme than a higher-delta option. That is to say, the percentage  change in 
the premiums for a 5-delta option for a given percentage change in the spot 
exchange rate will be higher than the percentage change in premiums for a 
25-delta option. In a sense, a very low delta option is like a highly leveraged 
lottery ticket on the event occurring. With a surprise rate hike, the odds 
would swing in Bhattathiri’s favor. Choice B is incorrect because the price 
reaction in the USD/NZD spot rate after the surprise rate hike would likely 
cause the NZD to appreciate; so Bhattathiri would want a call option on 
the USD/NZD currency pair. Choice C is incorrect because an appreciation 
of the NZD after the surprise rate hike would best be captured by a call 
spread on the JPY/NZD rate, which will likely increase (the NZD is the base 
currency).
3. Among the following, replacing the current risk reversal hedge with a long 
position in which of the following would best meet Khan’s instructions? (All 
use the ZAR/GBP .)
A. 10-delta risk reversal
B. Put option with a 20.1300 strike
C. Call option with a 20.1350 strike
Solution to 3:
A is correct. Moving to a 10-delta risk reversal will be cheaper (these op -
tions are deeper-OTM than 25-delta options) and widen the bands in the 
corridor being created for the ZAR/GBP rate. Choice B is incorrect because 
a long put provides no protection against an upside movement in the ZAR/
GBP rate, which Brixworth & St. Ives is trying to hedge (recall that the fund 
is long ZAR in its foreign-currency asset exposure and hence needs to sell 
ZAR/buy GBP to hedge). Also, if Brixworth & St. Ives exercises the option, 
they would “put” GBP to the counterparty at the strike price and receive 
ZAR in return. Although this option position may be considered profitable 
in its own right, it nonetheless causes the firm to double-up its ZAR expo -
sure. Choice C is incorrect because although an ATM call option on ZAR/
GBP will provide complete hedge protection, it will be expensive and clearly 
more expensive than the current 25-delta risk reversal.
4. Which of the following positions would best implement Zhang’s and Taka -
hashi’s market view?
A. Long a 50.2450 put and long a 50.2550 call
B. Long a 50.2450 put and short a 50.2400 put
C. Long a 50.2450 put and short a 50.2550 call
Solution to 4:
A is correct. Zhang’s and Takahashi’s market view is that, over the next 
month, a move in PHP/USD to either 50.2400 or 50.2600 is equally likely. A 
Currency Management for Emerging Market Currencies 205
strangle would express this view of heightened volatility but without a direc -
tional bias, and would require a long put and a long call positions. Choice B 
is incorrect because it is a put spread; it will profit by a move in PHP/USD 
between 50.2450 and 50.2400. If it moves below 50.2400 the short put gets 
exercised by the counterparty and neutralizes the long put. Although less 
costly than an outright long put position, this structure is not positioned to 
profit from a move higher in PHP/USD. Choice C is incorrect because it is 
a short risk reversal position. It provides relatively cheap protection for a 
down-move in PHP/USD but is not positioned to profit from an up-move in 
PHP/USD.
5. Which of the following positions would best implement Kilmarnock Capi -
tal’s minimum-variance hedge?
A. Long a USD/GBP forward contract with a notional size of USD1.2 
million
B. Long a USD/GBP forward contract with a notional size of USD3.3 
million
C. Short a USD/GBP forward contract with a notional size of USD2.0 
million
Solution to 5:
B is correct. The formula for the minimum-variance hedge ratio ( h) is:
  h = ρ   (   R  DC  ;  R  FX   )     ×    [    σ   (   R  DC   )     _ σ   (   R  FX   )       ]     
After inputting the data from the table, this equation solves to 0.33. This 
means that for a USD10 million investment in the S&P 500 (long position), 
Kilmarnock Capital would want to be short  approximately USD3.3 million 
in a forward contract. Because the standard market quote for this currency 
pair is USD/GBP , to be short the USD means one would have to buy the 
GBP; that is, a long position in a USD/GBP forward contract. Choice A is 
incorrect because it inverts the ratio in the formula. Choice C is incorrect 
because it shows a short position in the USD/GBP forward, and because it 
only uses the correlation to set the contract size.
CURRENCY MANAGEMENT FOR EMERGING MARKET 
CURRENCIES
discuss challenges for managing emerging market currency 
exposures
Most of the material in this reading has focused on what might be described as the 
major currencies, such as the EUR, GBP , or JPY. This focus is not a coincidence: The 
vast majority of daily flow in global FX markets is accounted for by the top half dozen 
currencies. Moreover, the vast majority of investable assets globally, as measured by 
market capitalization, are denominated in the major currencies. Nonetheless, more 
investors are looking at emerging markets, as well as “frontier markets, ” for potential 
investment opportunities. And many developing economies are beginning to emerge 13
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 206
as major forces in the global economy. In the following sections, we survey the chal -
lenges for currency management and the use of non-deliverable forwards as one tool 
to address them.
Special Considerations in Managing Emerging Market Currency 
Exposures
Managing emerging market currency exposure involves unique challenges. Perhaps 
the two most important considerations are (1) higher trading costs than the major 
currencies under “normal” market conditions, and (2) the increased likelihood of 
extreme market events and severe illiquidity under stressed market conditions.
Many emerging market currencies are thinly traded, causing higher transaction 
costs (bid–offer spreads). There may also be fewer derivatives products to choose 
from, especially exchange-traded products. Although many global investment banks 
will quote spot rates and OTC derivatives for almost any conceivable currency pair, 
many of these are often seen as “specialty” products and often come with relatively 
high mark-ups. This mark-up increases trading and hedging costs. (In addition, the 
underlying foreign-currency asset in emerging markets can be illiquid and lack the 
full array of derivatives products.)
These higher currency trading costs would especially be the case for “crosses” in 
these currency pairs. For example, there is no reason why an investor in Chile (which 
uses the Chilean peso, currency code CLP) could not have an investment in assets 
denominated in the Thai baht (THB). But the CLP/THB cross is likely to be very thinly 
traded; there simply are not enough trade or capital flows between these two countries. 
Typically, any trade between these two currencies would go through a major inter -
mediary currency, usually the USD. Hence, the trade would be broken into two legs: 
a trade in the CLP/USD pair and another in the THB/USD pair. These trades might 
go through different traders or trading desks at the same bank; or perhaps one leg of 
the trade would be done at one bank and the other leg through a different bank. There 
may also be time zone issues affecting liquidity; one leg of the trade may be relatively 
liquid at the same time as the other leg of the trade may be more thinly traded. The 
reason is because liquidity in most emerging market currencies is typically deepest 
in their domestic time zones. In any event, there are two bid–offer spreads—one for 
each leg of the trade—to be covered. This is often the case for many of the cross-rate 
currency pairs among developed market currencies as well. However, the bid–offer 
spreads are usually tighter for major currency pairs.
The liquidity issue is especially important when trades in these less-liquid cur -
rencies get “crowded, ” for example, through an excessive build-up of carry trades or 
through a fad-like popularity among investors for investing in a particular region 
or trading theme. Trades can be much easier to gradually enter into than to quickly 
exit, particularly under stressed market conditions. For example, after a long period 
of slow build-up, carry trades into these currencies can occasionally be subject to 
panicked unwinds as market conditions suddenly turn. This situation typically causes 
market liquidity to evaporate and leaves traders locked into positions that continue 
to accumulate losses.
The investment return probability distributions for currency (and other) trades 
subject to such relatively frequent extreme events have fatter tails than the normal 
distribution as well as a pronounced negative skew. Risk measurement and control 
tools (such as value at risk, or VaR) that depend on normal distributions can be mis -
leading under these circumstances and greatly understate the risks the portfolio is 
actually exposed to. Many investment performance measures are also based on the

the Sharpe ratio can look very attractive during times of relative tranquility; but this 
seeming outperformance can disappear into deep losses faster than most investors can 
Currency Management for Emerging Market Currencies 207
react (investors typically do a poor job of timing crises). As mentioned in the prior 
section on volatility trading, price volatility in financial markets is very cyclical and 
implied volatility can be subject to sharp spikes. These volatility spikes can severely 
affect both option prices and hedging strategies based on options. Even if the initial 
option protection is in place, it will eventually have to be rolled as options expire—but 
then at much higher prices for the option buyer.
The occurrence of currency crises can also affect hedging strategies based on 
forward contracts. Recall that hedging a long exposure to a foreign currency typically 
involves selling the foreign currency forward. However, when currencies are under 
severe downward pressure, central banks often react by hiking the policy rate to sup -
port the domestic currency. But recall that the higher interest rates go in a country, 
then, all else equal, the deeper the forward discount for its currency (enforced by 
the arbitrage conditions of covered interest rate parity). Having to sell the currency 
forward at increasingly deep discounts will cause losses through negative roll yield 
and undermine the cost effectiveness of the hedging program.
Extreme price movements in financial markets can also undermine many hedg -
ing strategies based on presumed diversification. Crises not only affect the volatility 
in asset prices but also their correlations, primarily through “contagion” effects. 
The history of financial markets (circa 2012) has been characterized by a “risk-on, 
risk-off” environment dominated by swings in investor sentiment between speculative 
enthusiasm and pronounced flight-to-safety flows. In the process, there is often little 
differentiation between individual currencies, which tend to get traded together in 
broader baskets (such as “haven currencies”—USD, JPY, and CHF—and “commodity 
currencies”—AUD, NZD, and ZAR). Investors who may have believed that they had 
diversified their portfolio through a broad array of exposures in emerging markets 
may find instead in crises that they doubled-up their currency exposures. (Likewise, 
there can be correlated and extreme movements in the underlying assets of these 
foreign-currency exposures.)
Another potential factor affecting currency management in these “exotic” markets 
is government involvement in setting the exchange rate through such measures as 
foreign exchange market intervention, capital controls, and pegged (or at least tightly 
managed) exchange rates. These measures too can lead to occasional extreme events 
in markets; for example, when central banks intervene or when currency pegs change 
or get broken. Short-term stability in these government-influenced markets can lull 
traders into a false sense of overconfidence and over-positioning. When currency 
pegs break, the break can happen quickly. Assuming that investment returns will be 
normally distributed according to parameters estimated on recent historical data, or 
that correlation factors and liquidity will not change suddenly, can be lethal.
It bears noting that currency crises and government involvement in FX markets 
is not limited to emerging market currencies, but often occur among the major cur -
rencies as well. The central banks of major currencies will, on occasion, intervene in 
their own currencies or use other polices (such as sharp movements in policy rates) 
to influence exchange rate levels. These too can lead to extreme events in currency 
markets.
Non-Deliverable Forwards
Currencies of many emerging market countries trade with some form of capital con -
trols. Where capital controls exist and delivery in the controlled currency is limited by 
the local government, it is often possible to use what are known as non-deliverable 
forwards  (NDFs). These are similar to regular forward contracts, but they are cash 
settled (in the non-controlled currency of the currency pair) rather than physically 
settled (the controlled currency is neither delivered nor received). The non-controlled 
currency for NDFs is usually the USD or some other major currency. A partial list of 
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 208
some of the most important currencies with NDFs would include the Chinese yuan 
(CNY), Korean won (KRW), Russian ruble (RUB), Indian rupee (INR), and Brazilian 
real (BRL). The NDF is essentially a cash-settled “bet” on the movement in the spot 
rate of these currencies.
For example, a trader could enter into a long position in a three-month NDF for 
the BRL/USD. Note that the BRL—the currency with capital controls—is the price 
currency and the base currency, the USD, is the currency that settlement of the NDF 
will be made in. Assume that the current all-in rate for the NDF is 5.5180 and the 
trader uses an NDF with a notional size of USD1,000,000. Suppose that three months 
later the BRL/USD spot rate is 5.5300 and the trader closes out the existing NDF con -
tract with an equal and offsetting spot transaction at this rate. Settlement proceeds 
by noting that the USD amounts net to zero (USD1,000,000 both bought and sold 
on settlement date), so the net cash flow generated would normally be in BRL if this 
was an ordinary forward contract. The net cash flow to the long position in this case 
would be calculated as
 (5.5300 − 5.5180) × 1,000,000 = BRL12,000
But with an NDF, there is no delivery in the controlled currency (hence the name 
non-deliverable  forward). Settlement must be in USD, so this BRL amount is converted 
to USD at the then-current spot rate of 5.5300. This leads to a USD cash inflow for 
the long position in the NDF of
 BRL12,000 ÷ 5.5300 BRL/USD = USD2,169.98
The credit risk of an NDF is typically lower than for the outright forward because the 
principal sums in the NDF do not move, unlike with an outright “vanilla” forward 
contract. For example, in the illustration the cash pay-off to the “bet” was the relatively 
small amount of USD2,169.98—there was no delivery of USD1,000,000 against receipt 
of BR5,518,000. Conversely, as noted previously, NDFs exist because of some form of 
government involvement in foreign exchange markets. Sudden changes in govern -
ment policy can lead to sharp movements in spot and NDF rates, often reversing any 
investment gains earned during long periods of seeming (but artificial) market calm. 
The implicit market risk of the NDF embodies an element of “tail risk. ”
Finally, we note that when capital controls exist, the free cross-border flow of 
capital that enforces the arbitrage condition underlying covered interest rate parity 
no longer functions consistently. Therefore, the pricing on NDFs need not be exactly 
in accord with the covered interest rate parity theorem. Instead, NDF pricing will 
reflect the individual supply and demand conditions (and risk premia) in the offshore 
market, which need not be the same as the onshore market of the specific emerging 
market country. Some of the most active participants in the NDF market are offshore 
hedge funds and proprietary traders making directional bets on the emerging market 
currency, rather than corporate or institutional portfolio managers hedging currency 
exposures. Volatility in the net speculative demand for emerging market exposure 
can affect the level of forward points. We also note that the type and strictness of 
capital controls can vary among emerging markets; hence, the need for knowledge 
of local market regulations is another factor influencing currency risk management 
in these markets.
SUMMARY
In this reading, we have examined the basic principles of managing foreign exchange 
risk within the broader investment process. International financial markets create a 
wide range of opportunities for investors, but they also create the need to recognize, 
Currency Management for Emerging Market Currencies 209
measure, and control exchange rate risk. The management of this risk starts with setting 
the overall mandate for the portfolio, encoding the investors’ investment objectives and 
constraints into the investment policy statement and providing strategic guidance on 
how currency risk will be managed in the portfolio. It extends to tactical positioning 
when portfolio managers translate market views into specific trading strategies within 
the overall risk management guidelines set by the IPS. We have examined some of 
these trading strategies, and how a range of portfolio management tools—positions 
in spot, forward, option, and FX swap contracts—can be used either to hedge away 
currency risk, or to express a market opinion on future exchange rate movements.
What we have emphasized throughout this reading is that there is no simple or 
single answer for the “best” currency management strategies. Different investors 
will have different strategic mandates (IPS), and different portfolio managers will 
have different market opinions and risk tolerances. There is a near-infinite number 
of possible currency trading strategies, each with its own benefits, costs, and risks. 
Currency risk management—both at the strategic and tactical levels—means having 
to manage the trade-offs between all of these various considerations.
Some of the main points covered in this reading are as follows:
 ■In professional FX markets, currencies are identified by standard three-let -
ter codes, and quoted in terms of a price and a base currency (P/B).
 ■The spot exchange rate is typically for T + 2 delivery, and forward rates are 
for delivery for later periods. Both spot and forward rates are quoted in 
terms of a bid–offer price. Forward rates are quoted in terms of the spot rate 
plus forward points.
 ■An FX swap is a simultaneous spot and forward transaction; one leg of the 
swap is buying the base currency and the other is selling it. FX swaps are 
used to renew outstanding forward contracts once they mature, to “roll 
them forward. ”
 ■The domestic-currency return on foreign-currency assets can be broken into 
the foreign-currency asset return and the return on the foreign currency 
(the percentage appreciation or depreciation of the foreign currency against 
the domestic currency). These two components of the domestic-currency 
return are multiplicative.
 ■When there are several foreign-currency assets, the portfolio 
domestic-currency return is the weighted average of the individual 
domestic-currency returns (i.e., using the portfolio weights, which should 
sum to one)
 ■The risk of domestic-currency returns (its standard deviation) can be 
approximated by using a variance formula that recognizes the individual 
variances and covariances (correlations) among the foreign-currency asset 
returns and exchange rate movements.
 ■The calculation of the domestic-currency risk involves a large number of 
variables that must be estimated: the risks and correlations between all of 
the foreign-currency asset returns and their exchange rate risks.
 ■Guidance on where to target the portfolio along the risk spectrum is part of 
the IPS, which makes this a strategic  decision based on the investment goals 
and constraints of the beneficial owners of the portfolio.
 ■If the IPS allows currency risk in the portfolio, the amount of desired cur -
rency exposure will depend on both portfolio diversification considerations 
and cost considerations.
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 210
 ●Views on the diversifying effects of foreign-currency exposures depend 
on the time horizon involved, the type of foreign-currency asset, and 
market conditions.
 ●Cost considerations also affect the hedging decision. Hedging is not free: 
It has both direct transactional costs as well as opportunity costs (the 
potential for favorable outcomes is foregone). Cost considerations make 
a perfect hedge difficult to maintain.
 ■Currency management strategies can be located along a spectrum stretching 
from:
 ●passive, rules-based, complete hedging of currency exposures;
 ●discretionary hedging, which allows the portfolio manager some latitude 
on managing currency exposures;
 ●active currency management, which seeks out currency risk in order to 
manage it for profit; and to
 ●currency overlay programs that aggressively manage currency “alpha. ”
 ■There are a variety of methods for forming market views.
 ●The use of macroeconomic fundamentals to predict future currency 
movements is based on estimating the “fair value” for a currency with 
the expectation that spot rates will eventually converge on this equilib -
rium value.
 ●Technical market indicators assume that, based on market psychology, 
historical price patterns in the data have a tendency to repeat. Technical 
indicators can be used to predict support and resistance levels in the 
market, as well as to confirm market trends and turning points.
 ●The carry trade is based on violations of uncovered interest rate parity, 
and is also based on selling low-yield currencies in order to invest in 
high-yield currencies. This approach is equivalent to trading the forward 
rate bias, which means selling currencies trading at a forward premium 
and buying currencies trading at a forward discount.
 ●Volatility trading uses the option market to express views on the distri -
bution of future exchange rates, not their levels.
 ■Passive hedging will typically use forward contracts (rather than futures 
contracts) because they are more flexible. However, currency futures 
contracts are an option for smaller trading sizes and are frequently used in 
private wealth management.
 ■Forward contracts have the possibility of negative roll yield (the forward 
points embedded in the forward price can work for or against the hedge). 
The portfolio manager will have to balance the advantages and costs of 
hedging with forward contracts.
 ■Foreign-currency options can reduce opportunity costs (they allow the 
upside potential for favorable foreign-currency movements). However, the 
upfront option premiums must be paid.
 ■There are a variety of means to reduce the cost of the hedging with either 
forward or option contracts, but these cost-reduction measures always 
involve some combination of less downside protection and/or less upside 
potential.
 ■Hedging multiple foreign currencies uses the same tools and strategies used 
in hedging a single foreign-currency exposure; except now the correlation 
between residual currency exposures in the portfolio should be considered.
Currency Management for Emerging Market Currencies 211
 ■Cross hedges introduce basis risk into the portfolio, which is the risk that 
the correlation between exposure and its cross hedging instrument may 
change in unexpected ways. Forward contracts typically have very little basis 
risk compared with movements in the underlying spot rate.
 ■The number of trading strategies that can be used, for hedging or specu -
lative purposes, either for a single foreign currency or multiple foreign 
currencies, is near infinite. The manager must assess the costs, benefits, and 
risks of each in the context of the investment goals and constraints of the 
portfolio. There is no single “correct” approach.

high net worth and institutional investors seeking international exposures. The

In prior years, the correlation between movements in the foreign-currency asset 
returns for the USD-denominated assets and movements in the exchange rate 
was estimated to be +0.50. After analyzing global financial markets, Konstanze 
Ostermann, a portfolio manager at Guten Investments, now expects that this 
correlation will increase to +0.80, although her forecast for foreign-currency 
asset returns is unchanged.
Ostermann believes that currency markets are efficient and hence that long-run 
gains cannot be achieved from active currency management, especially after 
netting out management and transaction costs. She uses this philosophy to guide 
hedging decisions for her discretionary accounts, unless instructed otherwise by 
the client.
Ostermann is aware, however, that some investors hold an alternative view on 
the merits of active currency management. Accordingly, their portfolios have 
different investment guidelines. For these accounts, Guten Investments employs 
a currency specialist firm, Umlauf Management, to provide currency overlay pro -
grams specific to each client’s investment objectives. For most hedging strategies, 
Umlauf Management develops a market view based on underlying fundamentals 
in exchange rates. However, when directed by clients, Umlauf Management uses

18. Kalila Al-Khalili has been hired as a consultant to a Middle Eastern sovereign 
wealth fund. The fund’s oversight committee has asked her to examine the fund’s 
financial characteristics and recommend an appropriate currency management 
strategy given the fund’s Investment Policy Statement. After a thorough study of 
the fund and its finances, Al-Khalili reaches the following conclusions:
 ■The fund’s mandate is focused on the long-term development of the coun -
try, and the royal family (who are very influential on the fund’s oversight 
committee) are prepared to take a long-term perspective on the fund’s 
investments.
 ■The fund’s strategic asset allocation is tilted towards equity rather than 
fixed-income assets.
 ■Both its fixed-income and equity portfolios have a sizeable exposure to 
emerging market assets.
 ■Currently, about 90% of exchange rate exposures are hedged although the 
IPS allows a range of hedge ratios.
 ■Liquidity needs of the fund are minimal, since the government is running a 
balanced budget and is unlikely to need to dip into the fund in the near term 
to cover fiscal deficits. Indeed, the expected lifetime of country’s large oil 
reserves has been greatly extended by recent discoveries, and substantial oil 
royalties are expected to persist into the future.
Based on her investigation, Al-Khalili would most  likely recommend:
A. active currency management.
B. a hedging ratio closer to 100%.
C. a narrow discretionary band for currency exposures.

states:
Statement 1 “Given the current stability in financial markets, several traders 
at our firm take advantage of the fact that most options expire 
out-of-the money and therefore are net-short volatility. ”
Statement 2 “Traders that want to minimize the impact of unanticipated

Rika Björk runs the currency overlay program at a large Scandinavian invest -
ment fund, which uses the Swedish krona (SEK) as its reporting currency. She is 
managing the fund’s exposure to GBP-denominated assets, which are currently 
hedged with a GBP 100,000,000 forward contract (on the SEK/GBP cross rate, 
which is currently at 10.6875 spot). The maturity for the forward contract is 
December 1, which is still several months away. However, since the contract was 
initiated the value of the fund’s assets has declined by GBP 7,000,000. As a result, 
Björk wants to rebalance the hedge immediately.
Next Björk turns her attention to the fund’s Swiss franc (CHF) exposures. In 
order to maintain some profit potential Björk wants to hedge the exposure using 
a currency option, but at the same time, she wants to reduce hedging costs. She 
believes that there is limited upside for the SEK/CHF cross rate.
Björk then examines the fund’s EUR-denominated exposures. Due to recent 
monetary tightening by the Riksbank (the Swedish central bank) forward points 
for the SEK/EUR rate have swung to a premium. The fund’s EUR-denominated 
exposures are hedged with forward contracts.
Finally Björk turns her attention to the fund’s currency exposures in several 
emerging markets. The fund has large positions in several Latin American bond 
markets, but Björk does not feel that there is sufficient liquidity in the related 
foreign exchange derivatives to easily hedge the fund’s Latin American bond 
markets exposures. However, the exchange rates for these countries, measured 
against the SEK, are correlated with the MXN/SEK exchange rate. (The MXN 
is the Mexican peso, which is considered to be among the most liquid Latin 
American currencies). Björk considers using forward positions in the MXN to 
cross-hedge the fund’s Latin American currency exposures.
28. To rebalance the SEK/GBP hedge, and assuming all instruments are based on 
SEK/GBP , Björk would buy:
A. GBP 7,000,000 spot.
B. GBP 7,000,000 forward to December 1.
C. SEK 74,812,500 forward to December 1.
29. Given her investment goals and market view, and assuming all options are based 
on SEK/CHF, the best strategy for Björk to manage the fund’s CHF exposure 
would be to buy an:
A. ATM call option.
B. ITM call option and write an OTM call option.
C. OTM put option and write an OTM call option.
30. Given the recent movement in the forward premium for the SEK/EUR rate, Björk 
can expect that the hedge will experience higher:
A. basis risk.
B. roll yield.
C. premia income.
Practice Problems 223
31. The most  important risk to Björk’s Latin American currency hedge would be 
changes in:
A. forward points.
B. exchange rate volatility.
C. cross-currency correlations.

35. Carnoustie Capital Management, Ltd. (CCM), a UK-based global investment 
advisory firm, is considering adding an emerging market currency product to 
its offerings. CCM has for the past three years managed a “model” portfolio of 
emerging market currencies using the same investment approach as its devel -

portfolio compare favorably with the one- and three-year emerging market 
benchmark performance net of CCM’s customary advisory fee and estimated 
trading costs. Mindful of the higher volatility of emerging market currencies, 
CCM management is particularly pleased with the “model” portfolio’s standard 
deviation, Sharpe ratio, and value at risk (VAR) in comparison to those of its 
developed economy products.
Recognizing that market conditions have been stable since the “model” portfolio’s 
inception, CCM management is sensitive to the consequences of extreme market 
events for emerging market risk and return.
Evaluate  the application of emerging market and developed market investment 
return probability distributions for CCM’s potential new product.

Portfolio A 15%appreciated
depreciated
Justification
The 19.5% domestic-currency return for Portfolio A is higher than the 15% 
foreign-currency portfolio return in GBP; therefore, the USD necessarily depreci -
ated relative to the GBP .
The domestic-currency return on a foreign portfolio will reflect both the 
foreign-currency return on the portfolio and the percentage movements 
in the spot exchange rate between the domestic and foreign currency. The 
domestic-currency return is multiplicative with respect to these two factors:
 RDC = (1 + RFC)(1 + RFX) – 1
where RDC is the domestic-currency return (in percent), RFC is the 
foreign-currency return of the asset (portfolio), and RFX is the percentage change 
of the foreign currency against the domestic currency. (Note that in the RFX ex-
pression the domestic currency—the USD in this case—is the price currency.)
 Solving for RFX: (1 + 15%)(1 + RFX) – 1 = 19.50%; RFX = 3.91%
Thus, the USD depreciated relative to the GBP . That is, the GBP appreciated 
against the USD because RFX is quoted in terms of USD/GBP , with the USD as 
the price currency and GBP as the base currency, and in this example RFX is a 
positive number (3.91%).

3. Any two of the following four points is acceptable:
 ■Trading requires dealing on the bid/offer spread offered by dealers. Dealer 
profit margin is based on these spreads. Maintaining a 100% hedge will 
require frequent rebalancing of minor changes in currency movements and 
could prove to be expensive. “Churning” the hedge portfolio would progres -
sively add to hedging costs and reduce the hedge’s benefits.
 ■A long position in currency options involves an upfront payment. If the 
options expire out-of-the-money, this is an unrecoverable cost.
 ■Forward contracts have a maturity date and need to be “rolled” forward 
with an FX swap transaction to maintain the hedge. Rolling hedges typically 
generate cash inflows and outflows, based on movements in the spot rate as 
well as roll yield. Cash may have to be raised to settle the hedging trans -
actions (increases the volatility in the organization’s cash accounts). The 
management of these cash flow costs can accumulate and become a large 
portion of the portfolio’s value, and they become more expensive for cash 
outflows as interest rates increase.
 ■Hedging requires maintaining the necessary administrative infrastructure 
for trading (personnel and technology systems). These overhead costs can 
become a significant portion of the overall costs of currency trading.
4. Optimal hedging decisions require balancing the benefits of hedging against the 
costs of hedging. Hedging costs come mainly in two forms: trading costs and 
opportunity costs. Gupta is referring to the opportunity cost of the 100% hedge 
strategy. The opportunity cost of the 100% hedge strategy for Portfolio B is the 
forgone opportunity of benefiting from favorable currency rate movements. 
Gupta is implying that accepting some currency risk has the potential to enhance 
portfolio return. A complete hedge eliminates this possibility.
5. A solution is to put in place a currency overlay program for active currency 
management. Because internal resources for active management are lacking, the 
fund manager would outsource currency exposure management to a sub-advisor 
that specializes in foreign exchange management. This approach would allow the 
fund manager of Portfolio A to separate the currency hedging function (currency 
beta), which can be done effectively internally, and the active currency manage -
ment function (currency alpha) which can be managed externally by a foreign 
currency specialist.

7. C is correct. The domestic-currency return is a function of the foreign-currency 
return and the percentage change of the foreign currency against the domestic 
currency. Mathematically, the domestic-currency return is expressed as:
 RDC = (1 + RFC)(1 + RFX) – 1
where RDC is the domestic-currency return (in percent), RFC is the 
foreign-currency return, and RFX is the percentage change of the foreign cur -
rency against the domestic currency. Note that this RFX expression is calculated 
using the investor’s domestic currency (the EUR in this case) as the price  curren -
cy in the P/B quote. This is different than the market-standard currency quotes in 
Exhibit 1, where the EUR is the base  currency in each of these quotes. Therefore, 
for the foreign currency (USD, GBP , or CHF) to appreciate  against the EUR, the 
market-standard quote (USD/EUR, GBP/EUR, or CHF/EUR, respectively) must 
decrease ; i.e. the EUR must depreciate.
The Euro-Swiss (CHF/EUR) is the only spot rate with a negative change (from 
1.0875 to 1.0780), meaning the EUR depreciated against the CHF (the CHF/
EUR rate decreased). Or put differently, the CHF appreciated against the 
EUR, adding to the EUR-denominated return for the German investor holding 
CHF-denominated assets. This would result in a higher domestic-currency return 
(RDC), for the German investor, relative to the foreign-currency return ( RFC) for 
the CHF-denominated assets. Both the Euro-dollar (USD/EUR) and Euro-sterling 
(GBP/EUR) experienced a positive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR ap -
preciated against these two currencies (the USD/EUR rate and the GBP/EUR rate 
both increased). This would result in a lower domestic-currency return ( RDC) for 
the German investor relative to the foreign-currency return ( RFC) for the USD- 
and GBP-denominated assets.
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 228
A is incorrect because the Euro-dollar (USD/EUR) experienced a positive 
change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against the USD (the 
USD/EUR rate increased). This would result in a lower domestic-currency 
(i.e. EUR-denominated) return relative to the foreign-currency return for the 
USD-denominated assets, since the USD has depreciated against the EUR.
B is incorrect because the Euro-sterling (GBP/EUR) experienced a positive 
change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against the GPB (the 
GBP/EUR rate increased). This would result in a lower domestic-currency 
(i.e. EUR-denominated) return relative to the foreign-currency return for the 
GBP-denominated assets, since the GBP has depreciated against the EUR.
8. C is correct. An increase in the expected correlation between movements in the 
foreign-currency asset returns and movements in the spot exchange rates from 
0.50 to 0.80 would increase the domestic-currency return risk but would not 
change the level  of expected domestic-currency return. The domestic-currency 
return risk is a function of the foreign-currency return risk [σ( RFC)] the exchange 
rate risk [σ( RFX)] and the correlation between the foreign-currency returns and 
exchange rate movements. Mathematically, this is expressed as:
 σ2(RDC) ≈ σ2(RFC) + σ2(RFX) + 2σ( RFC)σ(RFX)ρ(RFCRFX)
If the correlation increases from +0.50 to +0.80, then the variance  of the expected 
domestic-currency return will increase—but this will not affect the level  of the 
expected domestic-currency return ( RDC). Refer to the equation shown for the 
answer in Question 1 and note that Ostermann’s expected RFC has not changed. 
(Once again, note as well that RFX is defined with the domestic currency as the 
price currency.)
A and B are incorrect. An increase in the expected correlation between move -
ments in the foreign-currency asset returns and movements in the spot rates 
from 0.50 to 0.80 would increase the domestic-currency return risk but would 
not impact the expected domestic-currency return.
9. A is correct. Guten believes that, due to efficient currency markets, there should 
not be any long-run gains for speculating (or active management) in currencies, 
especially after netting out management and transaction costs. Therefore, both 
currency hedging and actively trading currencies represent a cost to the portfolio 
with little prospect of consistently positive active returns. Given a long invest -
ment horizon and few immediate liquidity needs, Guten is most likely to choose 
to forgo currency hedging and its associated costs.
B and C are incorrect because given a long investment horizon and little immedi -
ate liquidity needs, Guten is most likely to choose to forgo currency hedging and 
its associated costs. Guten believes that due to efficient currency markets there 
should not be any long-run gains when speculating in currencies, especially after 
netting out management and transaction costs.
10. B is correct. Umlauf develops a market view based on underlying fundamentals 
in exchange rates (an economic fundamental approach). When directed by cli -
ents, Umlauf uses options and a variety of trading strategies to unbundle  all of the 
various risk factors and trades them separately (a volatility trading approach). A 
market technical approach would entail forming a market view based on techni -
cal analysis (i.e., a belief that historical prices incorporate all relevant information 
on future price movements and that such movements have a tendency to repeat).
A is incorrect because, in using options and a variety of trading strategies to un-
bundle  all of the various risk factors and trade them separately, Umlauf is likely to 
periodically employ volatility trading-based currency strategies.
C is incorrect because, in developing a market view based on underlying fun -

damentals in exchange rates, Umlauf does utilize an economic fundamentals 
approach.
11. B is correct. Braunt Pensionskasse provides the manager with limited discretion 
in managing the portfolio’s currency risk exposures. This would be most consis -
tent with allowing the currency overlay manager to take directional views on fu -
ture currency movements (within predefined bounds) where the currency overlay 
is limited to the currency exposures already in the foreign asset portfolio. It 
would not be appropriate to use a fully-passive hedging approach since it would 
eliminate any alpha from currency movements. Further, a currency overlay pro -
gram, which considers “foreign exchange as an asset class” , would likely expose 
Braunt’s portfolio to more currency risk than desired given the given primary 
performance objectives.
A is incorrect because a directional view currency overlay program is most 
appropriate given the limited discretion Braunt Pensionskasse has given the 
manager. A fully passive currency overlay program is more likely to be used when 
a client seeks to hedge all the currency risk.
C is incorrect because a directional view currency overlay program is most 
appropriate given the limited discretion Braunt Pensionskasse has given the man -
ager. In contrast, the concept of “foreign exchange as an asset class” allows the 
currency overlay manager to take currency exposure positions in any currency 
pair where there is value-added to be harvested.
12. C is correct. The primary performance objective of Franz Trading GmbH is to 
add alpha to the portfolio, and thus has given the manager discretion in trading 
currencies. This is essentially a “foreign exchange as an asset class” approach. 
Braunt Pensionskasse and Kastner have more conservative currency strategies, 
and thus are less likely to benefit from the different strategies that a new overlay 
manager might employ.
A is incorrect because Franz Trading GmbH is more likely to benefit from the 
introduction of an additional overlay manager. Kastner is more likely to have a 
fully passive currency overlay program.
B is incorrect because Franz Trading GmbH is more likely to benefit from the 
introduction of an additional overlay manager. Braunt is more likely to have a 
currency overlay program where the manager takes a directional view on future 
currency movements.
13. Currency movements contributed 1.5% to the account’s 7.0% total (US dollar) 
return, calculated as follows:
The domestic-currency return ( RDC) on a portfolio of multiple foreign assets is
   R  DC   =  ∑ 
i=1  n
   ω  i   (1 +  R  FC,i   ) (1 +  R  FX,i   ) − 1 
Where RFC,iis the foreign-currency return on the ith foreign asset, RFX,iis the 
appreciation of the ith foreign currency against the domestic currency, and  ω  i    is 
the weight of the asset as a percentage of the aggregate domestic-currency value 
of the portfolio. This equation can be rearranged as
   R  DC   =  ∑ 
i=1  n
   ω  i    [  R  FC,i   +  R  FX,i   + ( R  FC,i   ×  R  FX,i   ) ] 
Therefore, the domestic-currency return is equal to the sum of the weighted asset 
return, the weighted currency return, and the weighted cross-product of the 
asset return and the currency return. The latter two terms explain the effects of 
foreign-currency movements on the Bhatt account’s total (US dollar) return of 
7.0%.
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 230
The weighted asset return is equal to 5.5%, calculated as follows:
 (0.50 × 10.0%) + (0.25 × 5.0%) + [0.25 × (–3.0%)] = 5.5%.
The weighted currency return is equal to 1.5% calculated as follows:
 (0.50 × 0.0%) + (0.25 × 2.0%) + (0.25 × 4.0%) = 1.5%.
The weighted cross-product is equal to –0.005%, calculated as follows:
 [0.50 × (10.0% × 0.0%)] + [0.25 × (5.0% × 2.0%)] + [0.25 × (–3.0% × 4.0%)] 
 = –0.005%.
Therefore, the contribution of foreign currency equals 1.5%, calculated as the 
7.0% total (US dollar) return less the 5.5% weighted asset return. Alternatively, 
the contribution of foreign currency to the total return can be calculated as the 
sum of the weighted currency return of 1.5% and the weighted cross-product of 
–0.005%:
 1.5% + (–0.005%) = 1.495%, which rounds to 1.5%.
14. 
Determine  the most appropriate currency management strategy for Bhatt. (Circle one.)
Passive hedging Discretionary hedging Active currency management
Justify  your response.
Active currency management is the most appropriate currency management strategy 
because with this approach, the portfolio manager is supposed to take currency risks and 
manage them for profit with the primary goal of adding alpha to the portfolio through 
successful trading. This primary goal differs from the discretionary hedging approach in 
which the manager’s primary duty is to protect the portfolio from currency risk and sec -
ondarily seek alpha within limited bounds. While the difference between active currency 
management and discretionary hedging is one of emphasis more than degree, the bounded 
discretion that Bhatt has granted Darden (plus or minus 25% from the neutral position) 
strongly suggests that Darden is expected to take currency risk and seek alpha with priority 
over portfolio protection from currency risk.
Passive hedging is not appropriate because with this approach, the goal is to keep 
the portfolio’s currency exposures close, if not equal to, those of a benchmark 
portfolio used to evaluate performance. Passive hedging is a rules-based ap -
proach that removes all discretion from the portfolio manager, regardless of the 
manager’s market opinion on future movements in exchange rates. In this case, 
Bhatt has granted Darden the discretion to manage currency exposures within a 
range of plus or minus 25% from the neutral benchmark position.
A discretionary hedging approach is not appropriate because Bhatt has grant -
ed Darden more than limited discretion (plus or minus 25% from the neutral 
position), indicative of an active currency management approach. The discretion 
granted suggests that Darden’s primary goal is to take currency risks and manage 
them for profit with a secondary goal of protecting the portfolio from currency 
risk. The primary goal of a discretionary hedging approach is to protect the port -
folio from currency risk while secondarily seeking alpha within limited bounds.
15. Given C&M’s research conclusion and the IPS constraints, the currency team 
should under-hedge Bhatt’s portfolio by selling the US dollar forward against the 
Indian rupee in a forward contract (or contracts) at no less than a 75% hedge ra -
tio of the portfolio’s USD10,000,000 market value. By under-hedging the portfolio 
relative to the “neutral” (100% hedge ratio) benchmark, the team seeks to add in -
cremental value on the basis of its view that the US dollar will appreciate against 
Solutions 231
the Indian rupee while maintaining compliance with the IPS.
Since the Indian rupee is assumed to depreciate against the US dollar, a 100% 
hedge ratio would largely eliminate any alpha opportunity. However, a hedge 
ratio greater than 75% but less than 100% (as dictated by the plus or minus 25% 
versus neutral IPS constraint) provides the opportunity to capture currency re -
turn in the expected US dollar appreciation against the Indian rupee.

Identify  the mostlikely  approach for Lee to optimally locate Wilson’s portfolio on the cur -
rency risk spectrum, consistent with IPS.  
(Circle one.)
Passive HedgingDiscretionary 
HedgingActive Currency 
ManagementCurrency Overlay
Justify  your response with two reasons supporting the approach.
      1. The portfolio is said to be in its flat 
natural neutral position because Lee does 
not have market conviction, which is consis -
tent with a discretionary hedging approach.      2. The currency hedge ratio requirement 
reflects some discretion with actual portfolio 
currency risk exposures allowed to vary from 
the neutral position within a 3% band.
Passive hedging is not likely because the IPS allows the 3% band around the 
neutral position. In addition, passive hedging is a rules-based approach, which is 
contrary to Wilson’s preference.
Active currency management is not likely because the 3% band around the 
neutral position is too limited for that approach. In many cases, the difference 
between discretionary hedging and active currency management is more of em -
phasis than degree. The primary duty of the discretionary hedger is to protect the 
portfolio from currency risk. Active currency management is supposed to take 
currency risks and manage them for profit. Leaving actual portfolio exposures 
near zero for extended periods is typically not a viable option.
Currency overlay is not likely because the 3% band is too small to indicate active 
currency management in a currency overlay program. In addition, currency over -
lay programs are often conducted by external, FX-specialized sub-advisers to a 
portfolio, whereas Lee is a generalist managing a variety of portfolios across asset 
classes. Finally, currency overlay allows for taking directional views on future 
currency movements, and a lack of market conviction is noted here.
17. The IPS revision allows for a more proactive currency risk approach in the 
portfolio because it was determined Wilson was too short-term focused and risk 
averse. Lee should structure the currency overlay so that it is as uncorrelated 
as possible with other asset or alpha-generation programs in the portfolio. By 
introducing foreign currencies as a separate asset class, the more currency over -
lay is expected to generate alpha that is uncorrelated with the other programs 
in the portfolio, the more likely it is to be allowed in terms of strategic portfolio 
positioning.
18. A is correct. The fund has a long-term perspective, few immediate liquidity 
needs, and a lower weight in fixed income that in equities (bond portfolios are 
typically associated with hedge ratios closer to 100% than equity portfolios). The 
emerging market exposure would also support active management, given these 
countries’ typically higher yields (carry trade) and often volatile exchange rates.
B is incorrect because the characteristics of the fund and the beneficial investor 
(in this case, the royal family) do not argue for a conservative currency strategy.
C is incorrect because a more active currency management strategy would be 
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 232
more suitable for this fund.
19. A is correct. Exchange-traded futures contract not only have initial margin re -
quirements, they also have daily mark-to-market and, as a result, can be subject 
to daily margin calls. Market participants must have sufficient liquidity to meet 
margin calls, or have their positions involuntarily liquidated by their brokers. 
Note that the risk of daily margin calls is not a feature of most forwards con -
tracts; nor is initial margin. (However, this is changing among the largest institu -
tional players in FX markets as many forward contracts now come with what are 
known as Collateral Support Annexes—CSAs—in which margin can be posted. 
Posting additional margin would typically not be a daily event, however, except in 
the case of extreme market moves.)
B is incorrect because futures contracts have low transactions costs. C is in -
correct because whether the EUR is the price or the base currency in the quote 
will not affect the hedging process. In fact, on the CME the quote would be the 
market-standard USD/EUR quote, with the EUR as the base currency.
20. C is correct. Based on predicted export trends, Subscriber 2 most likely expects 
the KRW/USD rate to increase (i.e., the won—the price currency—to depreciate 
relative to the USD). This would require a long forward position in a forward 
contract, but as a country with capital controls, a NDF would be used instead. 
(Note: While forward contracts offered by banks are generally an institutional 
product, not retail, the retail version of a non-deliverable forward contract is 
known as a “contract for differences” (CFD) and is available at several retail FX 
brokers.)
A is incorrect because Subscriber 2 expects the KRW/USD rate to increase. A 
short straddle position would be used when the direction of exchange rate move -
ment is unknown and volatility is expected to remain low.
B is incorrect because a put option would profit from a decrease of the KRW/
USD rate, not an increase (as expected). Higher volatility would also make buying 
a put option more expensive.
21. B is correct. Subscriber 3’s carry trade strategy is equivalent to trading the for -
ward rate bias, based on the historical evidence that the forward rate is not the 
center of the distribution for the spot rate. Applying this bias involves buying cur -
rencies trading at a forward discount and selling currencies trading at a forward 
premium. So a higher forward premium on the lower yielding currency—the 
USD, the base currency in the INR/USD quote—would effectively reflect a more 
profitable trading opportunity. That is, a higher premium for buying or selling the 
USD forward is associated with a lower US interest rate compared to India. This 
would mean a wider interest rate differential in favor of Indian instruments, and 
hence potentially more carry trade profits.
A is incorrect because Subscriber 3’s carry trade strategy depends on a wide 
interest rate differential between the high-yield country (India) and the low-yield 
country (the United States). The differential should be wide enough to compen -
sate for the unhedged currency risk exposure.
C is incorrect because a guide to the carry trade’s riskiness is the volatility of spot 
rates on the involved currencies, with rapid movements in exchange rates often 
associated with a panicked unwinding of carry trades. All things being equal, 
higher volatility is worse for carry trades.
22. C is correct. Emerging market currencies are often the investment currencies in 
the carry trade. This reflects the higher yields often available in their money mar -
kets compared to Developed Market economies (funding currencies are typically 
low-yield currencies such as the JPY). This can lead to higher holding returns, but 
these higher returns can also come with higher risks: carry trades are occasional -
Solutions 233
ly subject to panicked unwinds in stressed market conditions. When this occurs, 
position exit can be made more difficult by market illiquidity and higher trading 
costs (wider bid/offer spreads). The leverage involved in the carry trade can mag -
nify trading losses under these circumstances.
A is incorrect because return distributions are often negatively  skewed, reflecting 
the higher event risk (panicked carry trade unwinds, currency pegs being re-set, 
etc.) associated with the carry trade.
B is incorrect because although FX markets are typically efficient (or very close 
thereto) this does not mean that higher returns are not available. The key ques -
tion is whether these are abnormally high risk-adjusted  returns. Higher return 
in an efficient market comes with higher risk. The higher (short-term) return in 
the carry trade reflects the risk premia for holding unhedged currency risk, in the 
context of a favorable interest rate differential.
23. Statements 1 and 2 compare differences between speculative volatility traders 
and hedgers of volatility. Statement 1 best explains the view of a speculative 
volatility trader. Speculative volatility traders often want to be net-short volatility, 
if they believe that market conditions will remains stable. The reason for this is 
that most options expire out-of-the money, and the option writer can then keep 
the option premium as a payment earned for accepting volatility risk. (Specu -
lative volatility traders would want to be long volatility if they thought volatility 
was likely to increase.) Statement 2 best describes the view of a hedger of volatil -
ity. Most hedgers are net-long volatility since they want to buy protection from 
unanticipated price volatility. Buying currency risk protection generally means a 
long option position. This can be thought of as paying an insurance premium for 
protection against exchange rate volatility.
24. In currency markets, volatility is not constant, nor are its movements completely 
random. Instead, volatility is determined by a wide variety of underlying fac -
tors, both fundamental and technical, for which a trader can express an opin -
ion. Movements in volatility are cyclical and typically subject to long periods of 
relative stability punctuated by sharp upward spikes in volatility as markets come 
under stress. Speculative volatility traders among overlay managers often want 
to be net short volatility because most options expire out of the money and the 
option writer then gets to keep the premium without delivery of the underlying 
currency pair. Ideally these traders would want to flip their position and be long 
volatility ahead of the volatility spikes, but these episodes can be notoriously 
difficult to time. Most hedgers, in contrast, typically run option positions that 
are net long volatility because they are buying protection from the unanticipated 
price volatility.
In this case, Konev would most likely be interested in speculative gains on US 
dollar weakness, while the other institutional clients would be hedgers seeking 
to minimize trading risks. The concept of foreign exchange as an asset class 
for Konev will most likely permit Murimi to take foreign exchange exposure in 
any currency pair where there is additional value to capture. A volatility-based 
strategy for Konev would typically be net short, as opposed to net long, volatili -
ty to earn the related risk premium for absorbing volatility risk. In contrast, the 
institutional investors, as hedgers in managing net long volatility positions, would 
be exposed to the time decay of an option’s time value.
25. In forming a market view on such turning points in future exchange rate move -
ments (e.g., peaking in the US dollar) or timing-related position entry and exit 
points, market technicians follow three principles: (1) Historical price data can 
be helpful in projecting future movements, (2) historical price patterns have a 
tendency to repeat and identify profitable trade opportunities, and (3) technical 
analysis attempts to determine not where market prices should  trade but where 
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 234
they will trade.
Thus, when devising a volatility strategy, Murimi can use her technical skills to 
time entry and exit points of positions. She can identify patterns in the historical 
price data on the US dollar, such as when it was overbought or oversold, meaning 
it has trended too far in one direction and is vulnerable to a trend reversal. She 
would appropriately position US dollar trades to maximize potential returns from 
volatility shifts that could be associated with US dollar exchange rate movements.
26. In practice, matching the current  market value of the foreign-currency exposure 
in the portfolio with an equal and offsetting position in a forward contract is 
likely to be ineffective over time because the market value of foreign-currency 
assets will change with market conditions. A static hedge (i.e., an unchanging 
hedge) will tend to accumulate unwanted currency exposures as the value of 
the foreign-currency assets change. This will result in a mismatch between the 
market value of the foreign-currency asset portfolio and the nominal size of the 
forward contract used for the currency hedge (resulting in currency risk). For this 
reason, the portfolio manager will generally need to implement a dynamic hedge 
by rebalancing the portfolio periodically.
27. The fund manager should implement a dynamic hedging approach. Dynamic 
hedging requires rebalancing the portfolio periodically. The rebalancing would 
require adjusting some combination of the size, number, and maturities of the 
foreign-currency contracts.
Although rebalancing a dynamic hedge will keep the actual hedge ratio close 
to the target hedge ratio, it has the disadvantage of increased transaction costs 
compared to a static hedge.
28. B is correct. The GBP value of the assets has declined, and hence the hedge needs 
to be reduced  by GBP 7,000,000. This would require buying the GBP forward 
to net the outstanding (short) forward contract to an amount less than GBP 
100,000,000.
A is incorrect because to rebalance the hedge (reduce the net size of the short 
forward position) the GBP must be bought forward , not with a spot transaction.
C is incorrect because the GBP must be bought, not sold. Buying SEK against 
the GBP is equivalent to selling GBP . Moreover, the amount of SEK that would 
be sold forward (to buy GBP 7,000,000 forward) would be determined by the 
forward  rate, not the spot rate (7,000,000 × 10.6875 = 74,812,500).
29. C is correct. The fund holds CHF-denominated assets and hence Björk wants 
to protect against a depreciation of the CHF against the SEK, which would be 
a down-move in the SEK/CHF cross rate. An OTM put option provides some 
downside protection against such a move, while writing an OTM call option 
helps reduce the cost of this option structure. Note that Björk does not expect 
that the SEK/CHF rate will increase, so this option (in her view) will likely expire 
OTM and allow her to keep the premia. This hedging structure is known as a 
short risk reversal (or a collar) and is a popular hedging strategy.
A is incorrect because the ATM call option will not protect against a decrease 
in the SEK/CHF rate. An ATM option is also expensive (compared to an OTM 
option). Note that Björk does not expect the SEK/CHF rate to increase, so would 
not want a long call option position for this rate.
B is incorrect because this structure is expensive (via the long ITM call option) 
and does not protect against a decrease in the SEK/CHF rate.
30. B is correct. To hedge the EUR-denominated assets Björk will be selling forward 
contracts on the SEK/EUR cross rate. A higher forward premium will result in 
higher roll return as Björk is selling the EUR forward at a higher all-in forward 
Solutions 235
rate, and closing out the contract at a lower rate (all else equal), given that the 
forward curve is in contango.
A is incorrect because Björk is hedging EUR-denominated assets with a 
EUR-denominated forward contract. While it is true that the gap between spot 
and forward rates will be higher the higher the interest rate differential between 
countries, this gap (basis) converges to zero near maturity date, when the forward 
contracts would be rolled.
C is incorrect because forward contracts do not generate premia income; writing 
options does.
31. C is correct. A cross hedge exposes the fund to basis risk; that is, the risk that the 
hedge fails to protect against adverse currency movements because the correla -
tions between the value of the assets being hedged and the hedging instrument 
change.
A is incorrect because movements in forward points (and hence roll yield) would 
be of secondary importance compared to the basis risk of a cross hedge.
B is incorrect because exchange rate volatility would not necessarily affect a 
hedge based on forward contracts, as long as the correlations between the under -
lying assets and the hedge remained stable. Although relevant, volatility in itself 
is not the “most” important risk to consider for a cross-hedge. (However, move -
ments in volatility would affect hedges based on currency options.)
32. 
Determine  which type of hedge instrument combination is most  appropriate for Rivera’s 
situation. (Circle one.)
Static Forward Static Futures Dynamic Forward Dynamic Futures
Justify  your selection.
Static vs. Dynamic Justifications:  
1. Both Rivera and Delgado are risk averse.  
2. The portfolio’s IPS requires monthly rebalancing.  
Forward vs. Futures Justifications:  
1. A forward contract is less expensive.  
2. A forward contract has greater liquidity.
The hedge instrument combination most appropriate for Rivera’s portfolio is a 
dynamic forward hedge for the reasons noted below.
First, a dynamic hedge is most appropriate here. A static hedge (i.e., unchanging 
hedge) will avoid transaction costs but will also tend to accumulate unwanted 
currency exposures as the value of the foreign-currency assets change. This char -
acteristic will cause a mismatch between the market value of the foreign-currency 
asset portfolio and the nominal size of the forward contract used for the currency 
hedge; this is pure currency risk. Given this potential mismatch and because both 
Rivera and Delgado are risk averse, Delgado should implement a dynamic hedge 
by rebalancing the portfolio at least on a monthly basis.
Delgado must assess the cost–benefit trade-offs of how frequently to dynamically 
rebalance the hedge. This depends on a variety of factors (manager risk aversion, 
market view, IPS guidelines). The higher the degree of risk aversion, the more 
frequently the hedge is likely to be rebalanced back to the “neutral” hedge ratio.
A forward contract is more suitable because in comparison to a futures contract, 
a forward contract is more flexible in terms of currency pair, settlement date, and 
transaction amount. Forward contracts are also simpler than futures contracts 
from an administrative standpoint owing to the absence of margin requirements, 
reducing portfolio management expense. Finally, forward contracts are more liq -
Learning Module 3 Currency Management: An Introduction 236
uid than futures for trading in large sizes because the daily trade volume for OTC 
currency forward contracts dwarfs those for exchange-traded futures contracts.
33. When hedging one month ago, Delgado would have sold USD2,500,000 one 
month forward against the euro. 
To calculate the net cash flow (in euros) today, the following steps are necessary:
1. Sell USD2,500,000 at the one-month forward rate stated in the forward con -
tract. Selling US dollars against the euro means buying euros, which is the 
base currency in the USD/EUR forward rate. Therefore, the offer side of the 
market must be used to calculate the inflow in euros.
 All-in forward rate = 0.8914 + (30/10,000) = 0.8944
 USD2,500,000 / 0.8944 = EUR2,795,169.95.
2. Buy USD2,500,000 at the spot rate to offset the USD sold in Step 1 above. 
Buying the US dollar against the euro means selling euros, which is the base 
currency in the USD/EUR spot rate. Therefore, the bid side of the market 
must be used to calculate the inflow in euros. 
 USD2,500,000 / 0.8875 = EUR2,816,901.41.
3. Therefore, the net cash flow is equal to EUR2,795,169.95 – EUR2,816,901.41, 
which is equal to a net outflow of EUR21,731.46.
To maintain the desired hedge, Delgado will then enter into a new forward 
contract to sell the USD2,650,000. There will be no additional cash flow 
today arising from the new forward contract.
34. 
Identify  two  strategies Delgado should use 
to earn a positive roll yield.Describe  the specific steps needed to exe -
cute each  strategy.
1. Implement the carry trade. Buy (invest in) the high-yield currency and 
sell (borrow) the low-yield currency.
2. Trade the forward rate bias. Buy (invest in) the forward discount cur -
rency and sell (borrow) the forward premium 
currency.
Given that the base currency (the US dollar) is trading at a forward premium, the 
hedge requires the sale of US dollar forward, resulting in a positive roll yield. The 
concept of roll yield is very similar to forward rate bias and the carry trade. Here, 
Delgado is suggesting a strategy to pursue when there is a negative roll yield, 
because a hedger trading against the forward bias would be buying US dollars at 
a forward premium instead of selling them. The carry trade strategy of borrowing 
in low-yield currencies and investing in high-yield currencies is equivalent to 
trading the forward rate bias, not against it.
35. Emerging market currency trades are subject to relatively frequent extreme 
events and market stresses. Thus, return probability distributions for emerging 
market investments exhibit fatter tails than the normal distributions that are 
customarily used to evaluate developed market investment performance. Addi -
tionally, emerging market return probability distributions also have a pronounced 
negative skew when compared with developed market (normal) distributions.
Given these differences, risk management and control tools (such as VAR) that 
depend on normal distributions can be misleading under extreme market condi -
Solutions 237
tions and greatly understate the risks to which the portfolio is exposed. Likewise, 
many investment performance measures used to evaluate performance are also 
based on the normal distribution. As a result, historical performance evaluated 
by such measures as the Sharpe ratio can look very attractive when market condi -
tions are stable, but this apparent outperformance can disappear into deep losses 
faster than most investors can react.
Short-term stability in emerging markets can give investors a false sense of over -
confidence and thereby encourage over-positioning based on the illusion of nor -
mally distributed returns. Thus, CCM should not assume a normal distribution 
for its “model” emerging market portfolio. CCM should assume a fatter-tailed, 
negatively skewed return probability distribution better reflecting the risk expo -
sure to extreme events.
