The process of determining which mix of assets to hold in your portfolio is a very personal one. The asset allocation that works best for you at any given point in your life will depend largely on your time horizon and your ability to tolerate risk. Strategic asset allocation involves setting target allocations for various asset classes and rebalancing periodically. Tactical asset allocation allows for a range around strategic targets to take advantage of market conditions.",

Modern portfolio theory suggests that investors can construct portfolios to optimize expected return for a given level of risk. The efficient frontier represents the set of optimal portfolios offering the highest expected return for each level of risk. Factor-based investing has become increasingly popular, focusing on systematic sources of return such as value, momentum, quality, and low volatility factors.",
